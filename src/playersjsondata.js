            " - Virat Kohli is the only player in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to have played all seasons for one team: Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)",
            " - He was picked by RCB soon after he captained India to victory in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup and has been retained by them ever since",
            " - Kohli is the IPL's highest run-scorer with 7263 runs before the start of the 2024 season",
            " - He holds the record for most IPL centuries (7) as well as most runs in a season (973 runs in 2016). He has won the Orange Cap only once - in 2016",
            " - Kohli captained RCB full-time from 2013 to 2021 and led them to the final in the 2016 season, when they lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad",
            " - Kohli holds the record for the most prolific partnerships in the IPL, with AB de Villiers (3123 runs) and Chris Gayle (2787 runs)",
            " - His popularity has made RCB one of the most followed teams in the IPL, even though they haven't yet won a title",
            "India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.",
            "This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.  ",
            "Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs, and became the first batter to score 50 hundreds in one-day internationals.",
            "An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. ",
            "Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him.\n"

            "- Rohit Sharma has won six IPL titles: one with Deccan Chargers and five as captain of Mumbai Indians (MI), making him the joint most successful captain in the Indian Premier League.",
            "- He joined Mumbai in 2011 and became captain in 2013. He took them to their maiden IPL title in his first season as captain and went on to lead MI for 11 years before he was replaced by Hardik Pandya for the 2024 season.",
            "- Rohit is MI's top-scorer and one of only four batters with more than 6000 runs in the IPL. His only hundred - 109* against Kolkata Knight Riders - came in IPL 2012.",
            "- Rohit's best IPL season with the bat was in 2013, when he scored 538 runs in MI's title-winning campaign. In 2015, Rohit was the Player of the Final as Mumbai beat Chennai Super Kings to win their second IPL title. MI went on to win the IPL in 2017, 2019 and 2020 under Rohit's leadership",
            "Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.",
            "That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word \"talent\" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.",
            "Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won six IPLs in the first 15 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double. ",
            "Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him \"Hitman\" when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter. But Rohit still became known as one of the foremost hitters of colossal sixes of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a massive score every time he went past 50.",
            "His captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to five titles, won plaudits. He proved himself a methodical, studious and calm leader, one not averse to using technology and data to arrive at decisions. He was an able deputy to Virat Kohli in limited-overs formats in international cricket, winning India two titles in Kohli's absence, and took over as captain in all formats in 2022."

He was 22 years old at the time.",
            "Born in Lahore and a first cousin to the Akmal brothers, Azam made his way up through age-group cricket. His journey began at an under-15 world championship in 2008 and he played two under-19 World Cups in 2010 and 2012, where he was Pakistan's top run-scorer.",
            "\"We didn't have to guide him, he was on his own, but we were supportive all the way,\" Kamran Akmal said. Azam had the distinction of top scoring regularly in age-group domestic cricket before he was called up to the national side in 2015 and made his debut during the home ODI series against Zimbabwe - a rarity because Azam's rise was during Pakistan's isolation as an international venue due to security concerns. ",
            "His hat-trick of ODI hundreds against West Indies led to a Test debut in the Test series that followed, and Azam had to opportunity to cement his spot as the careers of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq wound down.",
            "He would grasp that opportunity, and then some. Over the years that followed, Azam became, far and away, Pakistan's best batsman, the most famous cricketer in the country, and among the best batsmen in the world. He is, even with so much of his career still ahead of him, one of Pakistan's best ever batsmen. ",
            "He was the second fastest player to 2000 ODI runs and the second quickest to 1000 T20I runs. He already has more ODI hundreds than all but two Pakistan batsman, and a World Cup hundred in a crunch game against New Zealand will go down as one of the great individual Pakistan ODI performances. While the first couple of years of Test cricket didn't bring the instantaneous success of white-ball cricket, steady improvements year on year have seen him rank among the best Test batsmen since the start of 2018, too. ",
            "Several Pakistan players of this generation have seen regressions after a few years in the side, but Azam, mercifully for Pakistan, seems immune to even that malaise. The increased responsibility Pakistan have dumped upon his shoulders - he was appointed T20I and ODI captain in 2019 before eventually captaining the Test side since 2021 - appears to have had little impact on his personal form for now. ",
            "While he doesn't quite have a reputation as one of the deeper thinkers of the game, his captaincy shows embryonic signs of modern progressive thinking, and Azam is very much learning on the job. There appears to be no attempt to ease any of the pressure placed upon relatively young shoulders, but Azam appears not to be feeling the strain for now. "

A right-handed opening batsman, Guptill has consistently been among the runs in ODIs notably making a double-century in the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup, but has struggled to make a mark in Tests.",
            "One of the reasons he hasn't had success in the longest format is his preference to play with hard hands and drive on the up. With the red ball's tendency to move more than the white one, and pitches for multi-day cricket being more responsive to swing and seam, Guptill has not been the force he could have been in Tests and has not played a Test match since 2016. Fairly odd for a man who plays some of the most pristine straight-bat shots. ",
            "Guptill showed he had it in him to dominate all formats, winning the Richard Hadlee Medal in 2011-12 along with being named ODI and T20 player of the year at the New Zealand Cricket awards. He claimed the latter two back in 2015-16 thanks in no small part to the 237 not out he made against West Indies in Wellington during the 2015 World Cup, the second-highest ODI score of all time. He was also the tournament's leading scorer with 547 runs, just ahead of two all-time greats in Kumar Sangakkara and AB de Villiers. ",

Despite his struggles, New Zealand entrusted him with batting in the Super Over in the thrilling final against England. The only ball he faced was the last, with two runs to win, he was run out agonisingly short of the winning second run that would have handed New Zealand the World Cup. ",
            "The first time Guptill gained recognition was in 2007-08, topping the overall State Shield run-charts. His efforts took Auckland to the final, and he carried his purple patch into the Emerging Players tournament in Australia, finishing as New Zealand's highest scorer. That earned him a call-up to the A side and then to the ODI and Test squads. "

            "Paul Stirling has long been recognised as a formidable cricketing talent both in Ireland and beyond. Before his 23rd birthday, he had already hit two ODI centuries against Pakistan. With a natural swagger and belligerence allied to a portly build, Stirling has evoked comparisons with Jesse Ryder. He generates huge power with seemingly little effort and is particularly strong lashing the ball straight or pulling the ball over midwicket. ",
            "Born in Belfast, Stirling made his ODI debut at the age of just 17. He played for Ireland in the World Twenty20 in England in 2009, and then signed a three-year contract with Middlesex in December 2009. The following year he gave further notice of his talent by thumping a 134-ball 177 for Ireland against Canada in Toronto - the highest ODI score made by an Irishman. While he struggled in the 2011 World Cup, he ended the tournament with 101 in Ireland's victory against the Netherlands, and a century in Ireland's ODI series against Pakistan in May 2011 had Waqar Younis purring. He added another against the same opponents in Ireland's tie with Pakistan two years later. Stirling also revealed his big match temperament with a pair of blistering innings - 79 off 38 balls and 76 off 43 balls - against Afghanistan in the finals of the World T20 qualifiers in 2012 and 2013. ",
            "While Stirling made a fine impression for Middlesex in limited overs cricket, he languished in the second eleven in the Championship. But when he got a chance in 2014, he averaged 43.87 in six games, suggesting that he was capable of managing the transition between the white and red ball. Although he has been troubled by a back injury, which has limited his ability to bowl, Stirling is also a highly competent back-up offspinner. He has frequently bowled his full allocation of overs for Ireland in ODIs and, with 1-45 from ten overs, was Ireland's most economical bowled during their victory over England in Bangalore in the 2011 World Cup.",
            "Stirling had long been a curious case in first-class cricket. The discrepancy between his first-class and limited overs returns for Middlesex had been infuriating. Before his maiden Championship hundred, he averaged 27.77 for the county against the red ball, but 41.46 in one-day cricket. So that century, against Yorkshire at Lord's in 2017, was a perfect celebration of Ireland's elevation to Test status which was formally confirmed on the other side of the Thames, at The Oval, a few days later. \"It's about time I did this and also about time I started to score more consistently. That said, I don't want to take away my natural instinct to play attacking cricket. That's the balance I have to find.\"",
            "Ireland were eagerly seeking to develop club standards as their status in international cricket grew but another century upon Stirling's return to play for his boyhood club, Cliftonville, caused brief resentment later that summer as rules excluded players with recent first-class experience from playing at this standard.  \"Farcical\" was how a tweet from Armagh described it after Stirling bulldozed their attack. Stirling captained Ireland for the first time in 2018 at the Hong Kong Sixes, and often found himself filling in when a first-choice skipper was elsewhere.",
            "As his belligerent form in white-ball internationals continued, Stirling found himself forced to make an unexpected choice in 2019 on account of Ireland's ascent to Test status: either, he could continue to play for Ireland, but count as an overseas player in county cricket, or he could renew his Middlesex contract but forego his international career.

            "A solidly built, aggressive batter from a country town in Victoria, Aaron Finch ascended to become Australia's ODI and T20I captain, leading his country to their first T20 World Cup triumph in 2021. ",
            "Finch has twice held the record for the highest score in a T20I: his 172 against Zimbabwe in 2018, surpassed the 156 against England in 2013. In 2014, Finch was named Australia's T20I captain, replacing George Bailey, but on the eve of the 2016 T20 World Cup in India, the selectors decided to consolidate the captaincy of all three formats and handed the job to Steven Smith. Finch at the time was the No.1-ranked T20I batter in the world but found himself suddenly struggling to hold on to his place in the side - though he had been an automatic selection in Australia's ODI and T20I teams, and had set the tone for their triumphant 2015 World Cup with 135 in their opening match against England at the MCG. ",
            "In 2018, amid a meltdown in Australian cricket in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal at Newlands, Finch found himself installed as the permanent national white-ball captain. He also made his Test debut in 2018 on the back of his white-ball form, scoring 62 and 49 on debut in Dubai against Pakistan, but endured a form slump in the home 2018-19 season after trying to adjust his technique to Test cricket and was dropped from the side. ",
            "He retired from one-day cricket in 2022 after a lean run with the bat, although he did lead Australia to a 2-0 win over New Zealand in his final series.",
            "Finch made his first-class debut for Victoria at 21 but did not play his first Sheffield Shield match until two years later.  Victoria had not always viewed him in their preferred Shield batting order, and nearly three years passed between his second and third first-class centuries. He made an unbeaten 288 against New Zealand in a first-class tour match in Blacktown in 2015-16, although that game was ultimately abandoned as the New Zealanders complained about the condition of the pitch. ",
            "Finch is an in-demand T20 cricketer, having played for nine IPL franchises as well as for Yorkshire and Surrey in England. He has also been a mainstay of the Melbourne Renegades side since the inception of the BBL and captained the team to their first BBL title in 2019.\n"

            "- He was plucked out of obscurity in his first season in 2009 by Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals). He was with them till 2013.  ",
            "- Warner moved to Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2014, was named captain in 2015 and won the title in 2016. ",

            "- Warner has breached the 500-run mark in seven IPL seasons, which is the most for any batter. Six of them came back-to-back. ",
            "- He has been an orange cap winner three times in the IPL - in 2015, 2017 and 2019 - a record, and has hit the most fifties in the league",
            "- Warner's relationship with SRH soured in 2021 and he was picked up again by DC in 2022",
            "David Warner player profile\nDavid Warner's extraordinary batting feats in all three formats for Australia will forever be overshadowed by his role as the chief protagonist of the Newlands ball-tampering scandal of 2018 and his place as a central figure in Australian cricket's ensuing cultural crisis.",
            "After he was charged as the man who instructed team-mate Cameron Bancroft to use sandpaper on the ball in the infamous Cape Town Test, Warner, though not punished by the ICC, was banned from international and Australian domestic cricket by Cricket Australia for 12 months, stripped of the vice-captaincy, and banned from leadership roles for life.",
            "He returned for the 2019 World Cup and enjoyed a prolific tournament before suffering a record-breakingly poor Ashes, in which he made 95 runs in ten innings. He bounced back later that year with an unbeaten 335 against Pakistan in Adelaide - the second-highest Test score by an Australian - during a home summer in which he received the Allan Border Medal.",
            "Prior to his ban, Warner had established himself as one of the best all-format openers in the world. In 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides, and he led the limited-overs sides with great success when Smith was rested. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England's Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It completed a remarkable rise for a player who burst onto the international scene in 2008-09 as a T20 specialist - he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on T20I debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well.",
            "His debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No. 2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second game he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did, carrying his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batting. ",
            "Later that same summer he made a very different kind of hundred, a 69-ball one against India at the WACA. In the seven-year period between his debut and the ban, Warner was far and away the best Test opener in the world.",
            "Away from international cricket, he has had a prolific franchise T20 career, especially in the IPL, and in 2021 became just the fourth batter to pass 10,000 runs in T20. \n"

            "For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often. ",
            "A limited batsman but a technically sound keeper when he first rose through the ranks, Rizwan made his international debut shortly after the 2015 World Cup when the slot behind the stumps was still up for grabs. He made a bright start against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, averaging nearly 60 with the bat in his first eight innings, but against more challenging opposition, his deficiencies were quickly exposed. A lengthy lean patch followed, and once he lost his place to Sarfaraz for the World T20 in 2016, there was little doubt who Pakistan's No. 1 wicketkeeper was. After the debacle at the World T20, Sarfaraz was appointed captain of the limited-overs sides, and consequently Rizwan's game time diminished further, coming to a complete halt until Sarfaraz sat out the last five games on the tour to South Africa in January 2019 serving a ban. ",
            "On the domestic circuit, Rizwan has been a prolific run-accumulator, averaging a shade under 50 in List A cricket and 41 at first-class level. He doesn't, however, seem to have the shots necessary to make him a valuable asset in T20Is, but with that being Sarfaraz's strongest suit, both as a batsman and captain, it would have been hard to dislodge him in the format at any rate. ",
            "Having made his debut over a decade ago on Pakistan's domestic circuit, Rizwan has been an ever-present participant in the Quaid-e-Azam trophy, plying his trade with the hugely successful SNGPL side, helping his side to three titles in the last four years. For that, the reward of a solitary Test cap in 2016 feels somewhat inadequate.",
            "He played for Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League, serving as back-up to Chadwick Walton for a couple of seasons, but once Sarfaraz Ahmed was dropped from the side, Rizwan's career trajectory skyrocketed.",
            "A 95 in Brisbane in his first Test since being called up got him off to a good start, but it was Pakistan's tour to England where he truly cemented his spot as Pakistan's first choice wicketkeeper. A pair of half-centuries in Southampton combined with a near-perfect series behind the stumps demonstrated to Pakistan they have found a long-term wicketkeeping solution, and Rizwan found himself appointed vice-captain of the Test side, and fast-tracked into the white ball team.",
            "T20s and Rizwan didn't seem naturally suited to each other, but 2021 has seen him make a mockery of those predictions with a record-breaking year. He began by smashing an unbeaten 104 against South Africa, followed up by seven further half-centuries that saw him amass the most T20I runs in a single year by any player. For good measure, he was also the second highest runscorer at the 2021 PSL - behind only his Pakistan opening partner Babar Azam - and led Multan Sultans to the PSL title. ",
            "His stability and consistency at the top of the order converted what tended to be a Pakistan weakness into a Pakistan strength. Rizwan now appears to be in the prime of his career, and one of Pakistan's most prized assets heading into the 2021 World T20."

            "- A move up the order unlocked his best. No opener - who has faced at least 1000 balls - has scored quicker than at Buttler's 146.65 since the 2020 season.",
            "- In IPL 2022, Buttler equalled Virat Kohli's record of four centuries in a season. And only Kohli (973) and Shubman Gill (890) have scored more runs in a season than his 863 in 2022.",
            "- In 2018, Buttler became only the second player after Virender Sehwag to hit five consecutive 50-plus scores in the IPL. David Warner joined the list in 2019.",
            "- Buttler started the 2024 season with 2696 runs already for RR, and is their third-highest run-scorer of all time.",
            "England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and quickly became a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018.",
            "Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. ",
            "As he entered his 30s, Buttler reached a new level in short-form cricket, becoming indisputably one of the world's best T20 batters. In 2022, he hit 863 runs in the IPL - the second-most in a single season - including four centuries to take Rajasthan Royals to the final. Later in the year, after taking over from Eoin Morgan as England's white-ball captain, he led them to their second men's T20 World Cup title as they achieved their long-stated ambition to hold both World Cups simultaneously. As Buttler and his old friend Alex Hales knocked off a target of 170 with four overs and 10 wickets to spare against India in the semi-final at Adelaide, it seemed bizarre that his promotion to open the batting for England's T20 team on a permanent basis in 2018 had been so controversial at the time.",
            "Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey.",
            "He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future.",
            "England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on England's tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away.",
            "There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgan's vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of England's one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career.",
            "Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, Buttler's Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstow's back-up during the following winter's Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge. Suddenly, Buttler was integral in all three formats once again.",
            "He remained integral to the 50-over side building into the World Cup, and started the tournament itself in flying form with 103 off 76 balls in a defeat against Pakistan and a quick half-century against Bangladesh. But time at the middle was limited through the rest of the group stage, and England were so dominant in the semi-final against Australia that he was not required. In the final, his skill in run chases came to the fore: coming in with England wobbling at 86 for 4 in a chase of 242, he kept them alive with 59 off 60 balls in a 110-run stand with Ben Stokes, and while he could not see them home, he managed seven runs off three balls in the Super Over, and completed the run-out of Martin Guptill to win England the trophy.",
            "The highs of World Cup success were quickly forgotten, as Buttler cut a tired figure over the next six months. He struggled for runs in the Ashes and in South Africa, and with Bairstow and Ben Foakes breathing down his neck, it seemed a matter of time before he would lost his Test place. He responded with a breathless 75 off 101 in the home summer against Pakistan to seal a run chase at Old Trafford, before grinding out his highest Test score - 152 - in the final match of the series. By this stage firmly ensconced as England's T20I opener, he continued to lead from the front in their bid to hold both World Cups simultaneously."

At the time, he was only the fourth overseas batter to score over 700 runs in an IPL season after Chris Gayle (twice), Michael Hussey and David Warner. ",
            "- Ahead of the 2024 season, Williamson's tally remains the fifth-highest in an IPL season behind Virat Kohli (973 in 2016), Shubman Gill (890 in 2023), Jos Buttler (863 in 2022) and Warner (848 in 2016).",

            "- Williamson has been part of two champion squads, SRH in 2016 and Gujarat Titans (GT) in 2022, but didn't feature in the final in either of those years.",
            "By the time Kane Williamson is finished with playing cricket, it is probable that he will be New Zealand's greatest batsman. Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. But he may also finish as one of the game's most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010.",
            "Williamson was born into a sporting family in Tauranga, the largest city in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty region. His father had played Under-17 cricket for Northern Districts, his mother was a representative basketball player, and his sisters played volleyball at age-group level. Williamson took to cricket and it grew beyond a hobby quite quickly.",
            "He was modest about his skills, too, - \"Everyone is gifted, I guess, but you get some that seem exceptionally so. I'm not one of them,\" - yet Williamson was billed to make it since he was 14. He scored a century on Test debut at the age of 20, and at 24 years and 151 days he was the youngest New Zealand batsman to 3000 Test runs- younger than Don Bradman too.",
            "At the crease, Williamson is comfortable against pace and spin, and he trusts the coaching manual explicitly despite the mutation of batting in the Twenty20 era. Among his best performances is his maiden Test double-century in January 2015, which helped New Zealand come from behind and beat Sri Lanka in Wellington. The innings was a testament to Williamson's hunger for runs and batting time - he was dissatisfied despite making 242 in over 10 hours.",
            "Williamson has made his orthodoxy work and is capable of scoring at a brisk tempo - he has a T20 hundred for Northern Knights and became the quickest New Zealand batsman, and fifth overall, to 3000 ODI runs. For a measure of his consistency, he has two streaks of five or more successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs in 20 months since 2014.",
            "He is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation. ",
            "Williamson is also an outstanding catcher and a part-time offspinner, though he needed to remodel his bowling after being banned from bowling in international cricket in June 2014 for an illegal action.",
            "With the mental strength to match his skills, Williamson was an automatic choice to take over the captaincy at the World T20 in 2016, soon after the retirement of the inspirational Brendon McCullum. Williamson led the team to four back-to-back victories in India, and was highly praised for his tactics that helped the team adapt to slow, turning pitches, before they were beaten by England in the semi-final.",
            "In 2018, Williamson led New Zealand to two famous Test series wins. In April, he became the fourth New Zealand captain to win a series against England. In December, he was the chief architect of New Zealand's first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years, with 89 and 139 in the final Test. He became the first New Zealander to score 20 Test centuries in 2019 with an unbeaten double century against Bangladesh at home. "

            "An opening batsman and handy offspin bowler, Mohammad Hafeez first played for Pakistan in 2003, but it was only in 2011 that he finally became a regular in the side in all formats.",
            "As a player, Hafeez gives the team plenty of options: he usually bats aggressively at the top of the order, but his organised technique also means he can switch to defensive mode if required. He doesn't flight his offbreaks much, but his excellent control over line and length allows the captain to use him at almost any stage of an innings. He is also one of the better fielders in the Pakistan team, especially in the point region.",
            "Despite these skills, Hafeez failed to create a regular place for himself in the Pakistan in his first seven years in international cricket, primarily due to his inability to convert his starts into substantial scores. He scored plenty of pretty 30s and 40s, laced with some exquisite cover-drives, but that only helped cement the opinion that Hafeez may forever remain a player whose potential exceeds performance.",
            "To a large extent, that changed in 2011, as Hafeez put in consistent displays with both bat and ball in all forms of the game. It actually started in the series against South Africa in November 2010, and then continued through 2011, a year which fetched him two centuries in Tests and three in ODIs, apart from two fifties in Twenty20 internationals. He won an incredible ten Man-of-the-Match awards in international cricket that year, and became only the third cricketer - after Sanath Jayasuriya and Jacques Kallis - to score 1000-plus runs and take 30 or more wickets in ODIs in a calendar year. With Taufeeq Umar, he formed Pakistan's most stable opening combination in Tests, as his aggression at the top of the order became a perfect counterfoil to Taufeeq's defensive approach. ",
            "Since then, Hafeez has continued to frustrate and amaze, and the frequency with which he can switch from one mode to the other is a large part of his enigma. By many metrics, he's one of Pakistan's most prolific cricketers, but arguably also one of the more profligate ones in the way he's handled his immense talent. ",
            "The elegance of the full face of his bat, particularly when driving through the off side, means any runs he scores are more memorable than they otherwise might be - and there have been plenty of them; he's number 10 on the all time ODI runs list for Pakistan. There was a century against India in Dhaka that preceded a disappointing barren spell, and then a purple patch against Sri Lanka where he smashed three hundreds in four games in 2013. A swashbuckling unbeaten 57 against India in the Champions Trophy final may ultimately be his most famous innings, as it powered Pakistan to a total they wouldn't let India get close to. ",
            "It is his usefulness with the ball, though, that has kept him lingering around the Pakistan setup for so long. His consistency gives his side another option, which explains the reluctance to drop him even when his stock skill - batting - is letting him down. He has opened the bowling for Pakistan on several occasions - particularly in T20 cricket - and briefly took on the mantle of lead spinner after Saeed Ajmal was banned for an illegal action. ",
            "That curse, however, has plagued Hafeez throughout his career too, and he has found himself suspended for an illegal bowling action no less than three times. Tellingly, it is in those periods that his place in the side has been in the greatest peril, as his technical flaws as a batsman appear destined to go largely unremedied. He was ignored for a recent series in Zimbabwe, but for a player with 50 Tests, 200 ODIs, a shade under 100 T20Is, and countless comebacks, one would have to be particularly brave to be writing his eulogy just yet.

Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. ",

He was subsequently briefly dropped from the ODI side but came back and made his third T20I century in Bangalore early in 2019 to help Australia chase 191. The ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE that followed was a high point as well.",
            "Late in 2019, Maxwell took a mental-health break from the game. The time away, along with conversations about his role with white-ball captain Aaron Finch, helped revive his form - he made five scores of over 45 in six ODI innings in 2020, had an impressive IPL season with Royal Challengers Bangalore the following year, and in January 2022, became the first batter to breach the 150-run mark in a BBL innings. However, he made little impact in the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups.",
            "He made his name for Victoria with a 19-ball half-century against Tasmania in 2010-11, the fastest fifty in Australia's one-day domestic history, and transferred that talent to the international stage. At the 2015 World Cup he blasted a 51-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in Sydney, then the fastest for Australia in ODIs, and the second-quickest in World Cup history. ",
            "Australia have also used Maxwell in Tests but to less effect - patience at the crease has not generally been one of his strengths. However, in Delhi in 2013 he had the distinction of opening the batting and bowling in the same Test, as Australia strove in vain to turn their disastrous series around.

            "Eoin Morgan became England's ODI captain in slightly chaotic circumstances less than two months before the 2015 World Cup and was less than enamoured with an entirely inadequate campaign. What he observed, not just from his own side's lacklustre display, but the inspiration provided by Brendon McCullum's New Zealand side, convinced him an entirely new approach was necessary, with a policy of no fear (and no retribution) at its heart. It required a man of strong will not just to say it, but to implement it, but Morgan did so, seeking to fashion an England side that would play with courage and be impervious to pressure or criticism.",
            "The revival he led was dramatic, culminating in England lifting the World Cup for the first time at Lord's on a nerve-shredding evening in July 2019. They went into the tournament ranked as the No. 1 ODI side, having set a host of new records, including the two highest scores made in the format. Morgan, relentlessly committed to this bold style of play on good days and bad, was at the heart of the transformation.",
            "Morgan's self-sufficiency and independent thought has caused him to tread a path that has not always been popular with English administrators. He preferred the IPL to county cricket long before it was ECB policy. Although he strove for a while to play for England in all three formats, he played the last of his 16 Tests in 2012 and his interest in the longer format appeared to wane once he recognised he had little chance of a recall. A somewhat private man, he is respected by his players for his inner strength, cool temperament and tactical nous but remains largely a closed book to those outside the dressing room.",
            "Once the selectors had decided to dispense with Alastair Cook just before Christmas in 2014, Morgan, the regular ODI deputy, was the most obvious candidate. A left-hander who quickly built a reputation for inventive and audacious strokeplay, Morgan also possessed the patience and power of shot to be a natural \"finisher\" - a role England had struggled to fill for a decade. In some ways, he was a prototype, encouraging the English game to adopt a more inventive approach only subsequently to face up to the challenge that he might be overtaken by more highly-powered models.",
            "As a young man in Dublin, Morgan was recognised as a cricketer of rare unorthodox talent, who plays the ball exceptionally late and was adroit both at sweeping and reverse sweeping. Time at Dulwich College only hardened his desire to play for England, which he never tried to hide back in Ireland.",
            "Morgan made his Ireland debut at the age of 16, making 99 against Scotland in Ayr, and was soon signed by Middlesex, who gave him his debut a week after his 19th birthday. He floundered in the 2007 World Cup: batting at No. 3, he made only 91 runs in nine games. But he soon established himself in the Middlesex line up, especially in limited-overs cricket, and his switch to England was long anticipated. After securing Ireland's qualification for the 2011 World Cup, in April 2009, he was called up by England, thereby denying Ireland the chances to pick him in the World T20 and beyond.",
            "At the age of 23, he shot to prominence on the back of two match-winning innings against South Africa. First was a 34-ball 67 in the Champions Trophy in September 2009, followed two months later with an unbeaten 45-ball 85 in the opening Twenty20 of England's tour of South Africa. His bold approach and crisp hitting evoked comparisons with Kevin Pietersen.",
            "His growing stature was confirmed when he was the only England player to be awarded a new contract at the auction for the third season of the IPL in January 2010. He was signed for $220,000 by Bangalore, where he joined England team-mate Pietersen. But he failed to make an impression and was soon left on the bench. He returned to his best for England in the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean as his powerful shot-making and coolness under pressure helped England to their first triumph in global limited-overs events. With three ODI hundreds that year, his first for England coming against Bangladesh in Dhaka, his reputation was soaring.",
            "Despite a modest first-class record he was rewarded with a surprise call-up to the Test side for England's first Test of the 2010 summer, against Bangladesh. Walking out to bat at 258 for 4, he could not have asked for a gentler introduction and showed enough confidence to pick up his first Test boundary with a reverse-sweep. With the retirement of Paul Collingwood, a permanent space opened up in England's Test side. Centuries against Pakistan and India represented the high points, but a disastrous tour of the UAE in early 2012 effectively ended his Test career.",
            "He remained an indispensable member of the one-day side, though. And while there were prolonged fallow periods - from September 2012, for example, he went a year and 17 innings without an ODI half-century and, by the time he was appointed captain, he had scored one fifty in 19 innings - he produced enough outstanding innings to retain his place. Going into the 2019 World Cup, he was England's record run-scorer in ODIs.",
            "While his captaincy record at domestic level was not inspiring and the 2015 World Cup campaign was painfully poor, progress was fast once England embraced a new coaching regime and bolder selections. A watershed series against New Zealand saw England, so hesitant and mediocre at the World Cup, pass 400 for the first time in ODIs and secure their highest successful chase (both records that were subsequently overtaken). A new template had been set."

            "His basic game is tight, especially in the subcontinent. He isn't pretty, though there can be pleasantness in his high, stiff-elbowed drives and lofts. Square on both sides he is precise. Further, he runs well. With his flattish, very modern off-spin always useful for more than a few overs and a wicket here and there - less so after concerns over his action - and an athletic and languid presence in the field, Malik should be far greater a sum of his parts than he actually is."

As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief and an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams.",
            "The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings.",
            "In ODIs, Shakib's contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5.",
            "Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasn't surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakib's removal as captain.",
            "His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015. ",
            "In the 2019 World Cup, Shakib hit his peak with the bat: playing the No. 3 role, he went past fifty in seven out of eight innings, with a lowest score of 41. That streak included two centuries, including an unbeaten 124 off 99 balls as Bangladesh chased down West Indies' 321 inside 42 overs - a record ODI chase for the country. Shakib finished the tournament third on the batting charts with 606 runs at 86.57, and also took a five-wicket haul against Afghanistan. ",
            "The highs from that World Cup would dissolve shortly after. Shakib was suspended from all cricket for two years, with one year suspended, after accepting three charges of breaching the ICC's anti-corruption code. He was found guilty of not reporting approaches from bookies during series with Bangladesh as well as at the IPL during his time with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. ",
            "The suspension would have effectively ended his chances of participating in the T20 World Cup in 2020, but the Covid-19 pandemic meant the tournament was postponed, and that a large part of Shakib's suspension went by without his missing too much cricket with the national team. Shakib was back in the set up soon after, and said he regretted and repented his actions, and that the suspension and the pandemic had made him rethink life.",
            "In 2021, he had another run-in with the authorities. This time, during the Dhaka Premier League. Playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club against Abahani Limited, Shakib was caught on video first kicking the stumps and remonstrating with the umpire after his lbw appeal had been turned down, and later ripping them out in anger after the umpire called for the covers when it had begun to rain. He was subsequently banned for three matches and fined Taka 5 lakh (USD 5800 approx)."

By 21, he shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats for South Africa. ",
            "De Kock grew up as a baseball player and even considered a move to the United States, but his father convinced him to pursue cricket instead. He attended King Edward VII High School, the alma mater of Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie, and was picked for the South African U-19 side, which he captained briefly. He also topped the batting charts for South Africa in the 2012 junior World Cup in Australia.",
            "Later that year he caught the national selectors' eyes when he starred in a match-winning partnership with McKenzie in the Champions League T20 against Mumbai Indians. He also finished fourth in the first-class rankings in the 2012-13 season. ",
            "After a bit of a false start to his international career - he didn't do much against New Zealand and Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013 - he scored his first ODI hundred against Pakistan later that year. Then came the three in a row against India, followed by his Test debut early in 2014. ",
            "An ankle injury threatened to put de Kock out of the 2015 World Cup, but he recovered quickly - if only to struggle through that tournament and a series against Bangladesh, after which he was dropped and spent some productive time in the A team. ",
            "His first Test hundred came against England in Centurion in 2016, and he followed that up with one against Australia three matches later in Adelaide, in a series South Africa won 2-1. He also hit his stride in the shortest format, scoring his maiden half-century in the T20 World Cup that year, in which he was South Africa's most successful batter. Elsewhere in T20, he was a key part of the Mumbai Indians side that won two IPL titles on the trot at the tail end of the 2010s, opening their batting and keeping. ",
            "In late 2021, de Kock announced a shock retirement from Tests, becoming another in a growing list of top all-format players seeking to concentrate on the white-ball formats.\n"

McCullum described himself as \"brash\" and that innings was proof, but he was also a key part of New Zealand's Test team since 2004.

His succession was anything but smooth, with Ross Taylor, the captain he replaced, opting out of New Zealand's subsequent tour of South Africa amid controversy. However, McCullum slowly moulded New Zealand into a terrific - and hugely popular - team in all formats, not only in terms of their results but also in the manner in which they played the game: attacking with both bat and ball, but without any of the sledging and needless aggression that other teams often displayed. Under him, New Zealand reached the World Cup final for the first time, in 2015, and went 13 consecutive home Tests without a defeat. By the time he retired in 2015-16, McCullum had become the first player to play in 100 consecutive New Zealand Tests from his debut."

That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistan's progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009. Nabi struck 58 against Scotland on one-day international debut and 102 in his first first-class game for Afghanistan, against a Zimbabwe XI."

            "Alex Hales' central role in England's T20 World Cup win in 2022 ensured he would be remembered for what he achieved, rather than what he missed. Three years earlier, Hales had watched England lift the 50-over World Cup from his sofa; he was dropped a month before the tournament after news of a failed recreational drugs test broke in the media, prompting what Eoin Morgan described as \"a complete breakdown in trust\" between him and his team-mates.",
            "He did not play for England again under Morgan's leadership and was initially left out of their squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup. But Jonny Bairstow broke his leg on the golf course while the squad was being announced, and after discussions with Jos Buttler and Matthew Mott, Rob Key decided the time was right to end Hales' three-year international exile.",
            "He played warm-up series against Pakistan and Australia but came to life when England's knockout hopes were on the line, hitting 52 and 47 in must-win games against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. And in the semi-final at Adelaide Oval - a ground he had grown to love while playing in the Big Bash League - Hales hit 86 not out off 47 balls, including seven sixes, as England cantered to a 10-wicket win over India with four overs unused. ",
            "Hales made only 1 in the final but England still beat Pakistan by five wickets at the MCG; having feared his chance had gone, he finally lifted a World Cup. Nine months later, he decided that he should bow out on a high and retired from international cricket, reconfirming his continued availability in franchise leagues.",
            "At 6ft 5in, Hales was always a destructive players who thrived against fast bowling and was considered part of a brazen new breed of England batters when he made his international debut in 2011. Sporting talent is in his genes - his grandfather once took Rod Laver to five sets at Wimbledon - and Hales was the first Englishman to score a T20I hundred, an unbeaten 116 against Sri Lanka in the 2014 World T20.\nIt still took three years for him to make his ODI debut and the consistent mistrust of his skills in 50-over cricket encapsulated England's struggles heading into the 2015 World Cup. He was only brought into the side when qualification was on the line, and even then asked to bat out of position.",
            "He was backed and emboldened by Morgan, Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace after the World Cup, who retained him in their one-day side even when he endured a lean 2015 summer. ODI hundreds in Cape Town and Abu Dhabi over the 2015/16 winter vindicated their decision and in 2016, he broke Robin Smith's long-standing record for the highest score by an Englishman in ODIs, hitting 171 off 122 as England racked up a then-record 444 for 3 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge.",
            "By that stage, Hales' brief Test career had come and gone. England picked him for a tour to South Africa in 2015/16 and he played 11 times for them in all, hitting five half-centuries with an average of 27.28. But his strike rate of 43.84 spoke of a batter who found himself shackled by Test cricket, rather than liberated.\nIn 2017, Hales allowed his position as first-choice opener to slip away. He was suspended from the ODI side in the aftermath of a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub in September 2017, also involving Ben Stokes, which gave Jason Roy the chance to make a successful comeback to the side; Roy and Hales had previously formed a spectacular opening partnership, but Roy's with Bairstow was even better.\nIn February 2018, Hales committed himself solely to limited-overs cricket by signing a white-ball-only contract with Nottinghamshire and playing the IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad. He struck 147 at Trent Bridge during that rarest of things - an England whitewash in a one-day series against Australia.",
            "He was due to spent the 2019 World Cup as England's spare batter, ready to fill in whenever injury struck, but a second failed test for recreational drugs left him in limbo under the ECB's regulations: he was banned for 21 days, but the reason was not made public; Nottinghamshire said \"personal reasons\" were behind his absence.",
            "The truth was revealed by the Guardian while England were at a training camp in Cardiff, blindsiding Morgan. Morgan met with senior players and told Bayliss and Ashley Giles that Hales had to go. Hales spent the next three years travelling around the world, filling his boots in franchise leagues and waiting for a recall, which finally came in 2022."

            "One of the most entertaining batsmen in the Associate cricket world, and one who never shies away from theatrically celebrating even the most mundane milestones, Mohammad Shahzad is a throwback player to a time when a bulging waistline would be excused by most coaches and selectors as long as it coincided with a bulging runs column on the scoresheet. Shahzad has proven his worth time and again with a series of thrilling batting displays, often producing his own version of the helicopter shot, and his fearlessness at the crease makes him one of the few Associate batsmen capable of standing toe-to-toe against Full Member opposition.",
            "Shahzad had yet to make his debut when Afghanistan's magic carpet ride took them from WCL Division Five in 2008 to three straight promotions up the Associate cricket ladder, but he proved to be a valuable addition to the squad at his maiden tournament, the 2009 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa. Needing a win in their final Super Eight match to secure ODI status for an initial four-year period, Shahzad struck 73 in a 21-run victory over Namibia. Afghanistan made that that cherished ODI status more permanent, with Shahzad at the forefront of the batting unit, most prominently in T20s. He has played a starring role in each of Afghanistan's World T20 Qualifier campaigns to secure four consecutive berths at the World T20, beginning in 2010, and he is far and away his country's career leading scorer in the format. ",
            "Due to his adventurous strokeplay and the nature of Afghanistan's membership status, Shahzad has sometimes been unfairly stereotyped as a limited-overs specialist but he has an adaptable technique to play long-form cricket too. Eleven days after his 64* off 46 balls ensured a successful chase against Ireland in the 2010 World T20 Qualifier final, Shahzad engineered one of the greatest heists in first-class history, scoring a fourth-innings 214 not out to overhaul a target of 494 in a 2010 Intercontinental Cup match against Canada. ",
            "The one blemish on Shahzad's ledger is linked to his weight, which has been a fluctuating concern under different management regimes. The short and stocky wicketkeeper received a major wake-up call when he was left out of Afghanistan's final 15-man squad for the 2015 World Cup on fitness grounds by then coach Andy Moles. The sting of missing Afghanistan's maiden appearance at the ICC's showpiece event in Australia and New Zealand spurred him on to a wondrous revival and at the end of 2016 he was named the ICC Associate & Affiliate Cricketer of the Year, the first Afghan to claim the honour. ",
            "In January 2017, Shahzad achieved a rare feat of scoring two T20I half-centuries in a day, leading Afghanistan to victories over Oman and Ireland in the morning semi-final and evening final of the inaugural Desert T20 Challenge in Dubai. It would later emerge that in a drug test taken just days earlier, Shahzad tested positive for the banned substance Clenbuterol, which Shahzad claimed to have inadvertently ingested through his use of the weight-loss supplement Hydroxycut. After a provisional suspension started in April 2017, he was retroactively suspended for one year and became eligible to play again on January 17, 2018. "

Entering the fray with his team 106-4 - and soon 111-5 - in pursuit of England's 327, he hit six huge sixes in a 50-ball century - the fastest in World Cup history - to set up a historic three-wicket win. It was the highest successful run chase in World Cup history and imbued new urgency into Ireland's claims for greater opportunities against Test-playing sides. Stocky and with his hair dyed pink, in aid of a cancer charity, O'Brien instantly became a poster boy in Ireland and beyond.",

By the end of 2014 he had played for four English counties, and in T20 competitions in Bangladesh, the West Indies and New Zealand. While Ireland have been disappointed by their lack of opportunities - they played fewer ODIs against Full Members from 2011 to 2015 than 2007 to 2011 - O'Brien has remained a formidable cricketer for them, and hit 84* from 47 balls to secure a tie against Pakistan in 2013. He has also captained Leinster Lightning in the new Irish interpro series, and has been given the responsibility of captaincy when Ireland's county professionals have not been available. O'Brien hit consecutive half-centuries as skipper in the ODI series win against Scotland in September 2014.",

In the mid-2000s, he was just what New Zealand need in the wake of the mass of departures from their batting line-up: an aggressive top-order batsman capable of taking up the challenge to world-class attacks. In only his third ODI, Taylor hammered a superb 128 against Sri Lanka at Napier in 2006 and he followed it up with 84 at better than a run a ball in his first ODI outside New Zealand, at Hobart against Australia in January 2007. He scores heavily from the pull and from slog-sweeping the spinners (and sometimes the quicks).",
            "Given New Zealand's lack of Tests it wasn't until the 2007-08 tour of South Africa that Taylor made his debut and he struggled against the extra bounce. Back at home he was dropped against Bangladesh, but returned in style against England with his maiden century, 120, at Hamilton and then followed that with a memorable 154 at Old Trafford. A leadership role wasn't too far away and he was named captain for the tri-series in Sri Lanka in 2010 after Vettori and McCullum opted out.",
            "However, Taylor's two-year captaincy stint ended in controversy when it emerged that he and Mike Hesson, the coach who took over from John Wright, didn't have a comfortable relationship. During Taylor's 13-Test captaincy stint New Zealand notched up rare wins in Australia and Sri Lanka, but immediately after the Sri Lanka tour he stepped down in controversial circumstances, as Brendon McCullum was named captain in all formats. After deciding not to tour South Africa, he returned for New Zealand's home series against England, admitting that his relationship with Hesson was still a \"work in progress\".",
            "While taking time accept the decision, Taylor quickly reasserted his importance to the middle order and produced a prolific run of form in 2013 with 495 runs in five innings in a three-match Test series against West Indies. In one-day cricket he formed what McCullum would often call 'the best three-four punch in world cricket' alongside Williamson as New Zealand built towards the home World Cup of 2015. A year before the tournament he scored three ODI hundreds in three innings against India and Pakistan. He was consistent rather than prolific at the World Cup, but afterwards scored three hundreds in five innings against England and Zimbabwe.",

Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers.

Technique and footwork aren't his greatest assets, but most often he compensates with other skills. No batsman has taken to the 20-over format like he has. He showed early signs of his liking for that format by smashing the first century in Twenty20 internationals - a 57-ball 117 against South Africa in the World Twenty20 in 2007 - and when Twenty20 leagues mushroomed the world over and sought international stars, Gayle was the biggest beneficiary.

            "Gayle's free-stroking, aggressive style is obviously best suited for limited-overs cricket, but that doesn't mean he hasn't cut it as a Test batsman. When he has turned up for West Indies, his pugnacious approach has become an attacking weapon in its own right, in what's been a lean era for West Indian cricket. His 79-ball century at Cape Town in January 2004, on the back of a South African first innings of 532, was typical of his no-holds-barred approach. However, Gayle has also shown the ability to bat long periods and the hunger to make big scores. In 2009 against Australia, Gayle batted almost seven-and-a-half hours in scoring an unbeaten 165 to save the Test in Adelaide; in the very next game, though, he smashed the fifth-fastest Test century - off 70 balls - to indicate that quick-scoring remained his preferred method. Next year he batted almost ten hours and scored 333 against Sri Lanka and Muralitharan in Galle, becoming only the fourth batsman to score two triples in Tests, thus proving again his ability to bat long periods."

            "A bludgeoning left-hand batter with power and panache, Malan was born in Roehampton but brought up in South Africa. He made his first-class debut for Boland in 2005-06. In 2006 he played 2nd XI cricket for Middlesex and Worcestershire, having made his first-team debut for Middlesex in front of 20,000 people in a T20 Cup match at The Oval. As a 20-year-old in 2008, he came in at No. 6 for Middlesex to hit a brilliant unbeaten hundred in a T20 quarter-final against a Lancashire attack containing Andrew Flintoff, Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork. ",
            "Malan made his Test debut a month after his first T20I, but his first five Tests, against South Africa and West Indies, were far from exceptional, with an average of 23. However, England calculated he possessed fortitude, and at 30, the know-how to handle an Ashes series in Australia. He did exactly that by scoring England's first hundred of that 2017-18 series after they got to the WACA 2-0 down. It was a tough, grown-up innings at a time when England had to answer charges of off-field immaturity. ",
            "But he was dropped from the Test side after three poor matches in the 2018 summer and it took him three years to make a comeback. Towards the end of 2019, he won a place in England's T20I squad touring New Zealand, and recorded England's fastest century in the format at the time - a 48-ball century in Napier, which played a significant role in the 3-2 series scoreline.",
            "He was one of the leading run-scorers in T20Is in 2020 and his half-centuries in South Africa, including an unbeaten 99, took England to No. 1 in the format at the end of the year. Malan himself was the reigning batter in T20Is when he got his Test recall in 2021. But although he was one of three England batters, along with Joe Root and Ben Stokes, to score at least two half-centuries in the Ashes that winter, he was dropped from the side after England lost the series 4-0.",
            "Malan topped the run-scoring charts in the 2022 Hundred, making 377 runs at a strike rate of 167 in a title-winning campaign for Trent Rockets, and though he missed the 2022 T20 World Cup final through injury, he picked up a winner's medal that winter, as England became the first men's team to hold both the 50- and 20-over titles concurrently.

He loves to make room and thrash the ball through the off side, but the stroke that bears his signature more than any other is the one he developed for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 - the eponymously named \"Dilscoop\" shot over his head, which confounded bowlers and experts alike.",

He journeyed through from his adolescence to adulthood and stumbled upon the sport he sometimes played as a child, only to discover he is quite good at it.",
            "Born in Sialkot in the northeast of Pakistan, Sikandar had told his parents when he was 11 years old that he wanted to be a fighter pilot. He wrote the exam that got him into Air Force college. He was one of 60 to have won a place among 60,000 applicants. But in his third year, he failed an eye test. He was told that 7 out of 10 people have the problem in normal life, but for him a dream was shattered.",

He moved to Zimbabwe, where his parents had resided since 2002, and he made his first-class debut in 2007. He made one half-century in nine innings before completing his studies and returning to full-time cricket in the 2010-11 season. He had a more fruitful time, scoring 625 runs at an average of 41.",
            "The following season was again decent as he developed a reputation as an aggressive top-order batsman. Sikandar kept doing well in the one-day and Twenty20 competitions at the time, so it was natural for the selectors to turn to him for a practice match against the visiting Bangladeshis in 2011 when Vusimuzi Sibanda was injured. He did well, and it became clear that he had a future in Zimbabwe colours.",
            "Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) began a process to get him the necessary papers that would qualify him to play for the country and in May 2013, he made his international debut for Zimbabwe, in the first ODI against Bangladesh, thus becoming the 116th player to appear for Zimbabwe in the format. Four months later, he made his Test debut too, against Pakistan in Harare. By the time the 2015 World Cup rolled around, Sikandar was firmly settled into his role as the most adventurous batsman in Zimbabwe's top order, with a fondness for carving the ball through - and sometimes over - point, and a useful side line as an offspinner.

After a long recovery process, he was handy a substantial contract for Barbados Tridents in the 2016 CPL on Kieron Pollard's recommendation. Unsure whether his body would continue to hold up, Pooran looked to maximise his earnings by playing in every franchise league he could including the BPL, the PSL, the Hong Kong Blitz, the T10 and for West Indies B in the Global T20 Canada.

He hit fifties against England and Afghanistan, plus a thrilling hundred against Sri Lanka, and finished the tournament with an average of 52.47 and a strike rate of 100.",

However, he showed he is more than just a one-trick pony at the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. With most teams having finally taken the time to scout him and plug that shot with multiple boundary riders behind point, Munsey went back to his golfing roots to drive his way to a pair of half-centuries, including one in a Player-of-the-Match performance to complete a famous upset win over West Indies.

            "Fortune turned, though, and both Sehwag and Gambhir lost form dramatically, giving Dhawan a chance at the age of 27 with 81 caps and 5679 first-class runs to his name already. Dhawan grabbed the chance with arguably the best debut by an Indian batsman, smashing 187 off 174 balls to set up India's win in a Test that was reduced to four days. He was picked in India's squad for the Champions Trophy soon after, and carried his sizzling form into that tournament with two centuries in the side's first two matches."

            "Litton Das made his way into the Bangladesh senior sides following his exploits for Abahani in the Dhaka Premier League, and Rangpur Division in the National Cricket League in 2014-15, where he was the top scorer. ",
            "Perhaps the first wicketkeeper-batter in the country good enough to be seen as a long-term successor to Mushfiqur Rahim, he emerged from the northern district of Dinajpur, around 330km from the capital, Dhaka, beginning his adolescent life as a young cricketer at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan and impressing with his heavy run-scoring in schools and age-group cricket. Litton was picked in Bangladesh's Under-19 side in 2012, the year after he made his first-class debut, and over two U-19 World Cups, that year and in 2014, he cumulatively averaged over 50, with a century and three fifties.",
            "A compact batter with a good defence and flair, Litton made 44 in his first Test, against India in Fatullah in mid-2015, and followed that up with a fifty that helped fetch a first-innings lead against South Africa in Chattogram. In Bloemfontein two years on, he top-scored for Bangladesh with 70 after the home side racked up a massive total. He made 94 against Sri Lanka in the match after that, but his first Test hundred took nearly another four years to materialise, coming late in 2021 against Pakistan, in Chattogram again. He top-scored in the second innings of that game too, with 59, but Pakistan won thanks to a feeble performance by the other Bangladesh batters. That match came near the start of a nine-Test purple patch, spanning about 11 months running from mid-2021, in which Litton averaged a little under 60, making three hundreds and five fifties, including 102 after Bangladesh followed on in Christchurch.",
            "In the thrilling ODI Asia Cup final in Dubai in 2018 that India won off the last ball, Litton set up the game, scoring 121 in an innings where eight of his team-mates failed to get double figures. The following year, he played a co-starring role in the ODI World Cup win over West Indies in Taunton, making 94 in a massive partnership with Shakib Al Hasan.",
            "In the BPL, he has been a fixture for Comilla Victorians, featuring in three title-winning sides in his first six seasons with them and being their top scorer in 2022-23, one of those title-winning years.\n"

His promise was apparent when, batting for the Under-19s against England at the end of 2005, he smashed 112 from just 71 balls to help Bangladesh cruise to victory. The left-hander is regarded as one of the most exciting prospects in Bangladesh cricket and is arguably the hardest hitter of the cricket ball in the country. His elegance and style through the off side is a treat to watch but his trademark shot is the straight drive, capped with a text-book like follow-through. ",

He made his one-day debut against Zimbabwe in February 2007 and was included in the World Cup squad after playing just two matches. His straight six off Zaheer Khan after skipping down the track was one of the best shots of the tournament. He scored a stylish 84 in his debut Test, against New Zealand in Dunedin and has since firmly established his spot at the top of the order. His maiden century came in 2009 against West Indies in St Vincent, a match-winning effort. He then set a national record against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo when he blasted an unbeaten 154 in a tall chase."

            "Sean Williams is a bold, dynamic left-hand batsman, and one of the most striking features about his batting is his proficiency at the reverse-sweep. That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwe's finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering.",
            "Reverse-sweeps aside, Williams has other shots too, and plays them often. His precocious talent was apparent while he was still a teenager. He was expected to be called up at the time of the players' strike in April 2004, but his father Collin, a former first-class player and national hockey coach, refused to release him and insisted his son should concentrate more on his studies. Almost a year later, and with just one first-class match under his belt, he was drafted into the Zimbabwe squad to tour South Africa. Although he led the U-19 side in the World Cup in Sri Lanka in February 2006 - the highlight being a win over England - there were rumours both before and after the tournament that he was not happy with the board. This turned out to be true when he turned down a central contract the following month, opting to look for a more settled career overseas. He changed his mind three months later, however, returning to play for Zimbabwe. The on-off farrago resurfaced in 2008 when he again quit for a contract in South Africa, only to return weeks later. "

            "De Villiers made his Test debut as an opener against England in 2004 (in the same match as Dale Steyn), when he was picked after only 16 first-class matches. He was later moved into the middle order and asked to keep wicket, which he did successfully: he batted everywhere from No. 1 to No. 8 and performed well in most of those positions. ",
            "After a brief slump in form in 2006 and 2007, he returned early in 2008 with a blistering 103 not out in the Durban Test against West Indies. Later that year he became the first South African to score a double-century against India in an innings win in Ahmedabad. He followed that with 174 at Headingley and 106 not out in Perth, in South Africa's first series wins in the two countries since readmission. That was de Villiers' best Test year, with 1061 runs at 58.94. ",
            "He came close to those heights again in 2010, when he scored 996 runs, and in 2013, when he made 933. His 278 not out against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2010 was the highest individual score by a South African in Test cricket until Hashim Amla made a triple two years later. By then, de Villiers was South Africa's full-time Test wicketkeeper after Mark Boucher's retirement, as well as the ODI and T20I captain. ",
            "He was relieved from keeping duties once Quinton de Kock made it into the international side, and although he was appointed the Test captain in 2016 after Amla stepped down, de Villiers didn't actually assume the role. He ruled himself out of Test cricket for most of 2017 and in May 2018, retired from international cricket with the words \"I am tired\". ",
            "Outside of South African colours, de Villiers was also a batting legend in T20 leagues worldwide, especially in the IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore - for whom he made nearly 5000 runs at a strike rate of 158.63 in 11 seasons. After the 2021 IPL, de Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.\n"

            "Hamilton Masakadza was still a schoolboy at Churchill High School in Harare when he set the record - since beaten by Mohammad Ashraful - of being the youngest batsman ever to score a century on his Test debut, at 17 years and 254 days. This was against West Indies in 2000-01 when, batting at No. 3 instead of his normal opening position, he scored a composed 119 that was largely responsible for Zimbabwe saving the match after conceding a first-innings lead of 216. Earlier in the year he had not only become the youngest Zimbabwean ever to score a first-class century, but also the first black player in Zimbabwe to do so - a watershed moment in the country's history.",
            "A year later, though, he put his professional cricket career on hold as he began a three-year course at the University of the Free State. Although an agreement was reached that he would still be available for Zimbabwe if required, he could not maintain his form playing against club opposition in South Africa, and the national selectors initially decided to await his return to the country. But the Rebel crisis led to his early recall in the one-dayers against England where, unsurprisingly, he struggled before registering his maiden ODI fifty in the final game. His return to the Test match team brought mixed results, but he was Zimbabwe's best batsman, technically, on their tour of South Africa, where he showed an application lacking in his team mates.",
            "After being criticised for not being able to score quickly enough early on in his career, Masakadza's ability in one-day cricket has steadily increased and 2009 was a bumper year for him. He scored over 1000 runs in ODIs in the calendar year at an average of 43.48 and a strike rate of 88.08, including scores of 156 and 178 not out in the home series against Kenya, the first time a batsman has made 150 or more twice in the same one-day series."

Though he began his senior team career exclusively as a batter - he bowled just once in his first 22 T20Is and similarly in just a handful of ODIs while captained by Khadka - his disciplined offspin became a staple of the team's strategy when Nepal's fixtures resumed following the Covid pandemic. Not only did Airee begin to regularly bowl a full quota of overs, he was economical and incisive enough as a wicket-taker to dispel thoughts that he would be dropped over patchy batting form. ",
            "However, his biggest asset might be his electric fielding. Whether stationed inside the ring in the powerplay or out on the boundary during the slog overs at the death, Airee is a magnet for the ball, pulling off some sensational catches and spectacular run outs.\n"

            "- MS Dhoni led India to three ICC titles but he is nearly as famous for his exploits in the yellow of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.",
            "- Dhoni, known as CSK's \"Thala\" (leader), captained the franchise to ten finals in their first 14 IPL seasons and won them five titles - in 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 . He's led them to the playoffs in 12 editions, making them the most consistent team in the IPL. In a surprise move on the eve of the IPL 2024 season opener, Dhoni stepped down as CSK captain and was succeeded by Ruturaj Gaikwad.",
            "- Dhoni was bought by CSK at the first IPL auction in 2008 and - barring a handful of games in 2022 - has been their captain ever since. No other player has led an IPL team for so long. Only when CSK was banned for two years on corruption charges - in 2016 and 2017 - did Dhoni play for another team in the IPL: Rising Pune Super Giant(s).",
            "- Dhoni's most memorable season with the bat was 2018, when he scored 455 runs at an average of 75.83 and strike rate of 150.66 to lead CSK to the title in their comeback season following the ban.",
            "- Dhoni was the first to play 250 matches in the IPL, reaching the milestone in 2023, four years after he played his last international game for India. He had resigned as CSK captain ahead of IPL 2022, but took back the captaincy after his successor Ravindra Jadeja stepped down mid-way through the season. He led the team to the title in 2023, before stepping down from captaincy again next year.",
            "MS Dhoni probably ranks as the third-most popular Indian cricketer ever, behind only Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. He emerged from a cricketing backwater, the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, and made it to the top with a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scaled the highs and hit the lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. ",
            "Under Dhoni's leadership, India won the top prize in all formats: leading the Test rankings for 18 months starting December 2009, winning the 50-over World Cup in 2011, and the T20 world title on his captaincy debut in 2007.",
            "He seemingly emerged fully formed at 23, when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 not out within a year of his debut.",
            "Dhoni improvised abd learned, but he didn't apologise for his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He became a multifaceted ODI batter, one who could accumulate, rebuild, and unleash big sixes, all seemingly at will.",
            "Along the way he showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up the captaincy in 2007. A day before that announcement from Dravid, a young India side under Dhoni played the first game of the first T20 World Cup in South Africa, and went on to win the tournament. The ODI captaincy was a natural progression, and the Test role duly followed too.",
            "Dhoni brought to the captaincy a thick skin and the relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with India's coach, Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they repaid him by producing some of their best years in international cricket. Dhoni's sense of calm on the field mostly worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests tactically. Still, India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under him: in the 60 Tests he led in, they had a win-loss ratio of 1.5.",
            "However, after the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and a six off his patented helicopter shot, an ageing team lost eight straight Tests on the trot away from home and his captaincy came under immense pressure, which was then exacerbated by India's first home series loss in eight years, 2-1 to England in 2012-13. This brought about a new chapter in Dhoni's career, where he seemed more assertive as a captain, building a new team. He played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test in 2013 against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to four wins in a Test series. ",
            "Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came to winning both. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests.",
            "On the tour of Australia that followed, India competed ferociously, thanks to a young batting core led by Kohli, but it didn't quite show in their results. Dhoni announced after the third Test, in Melbourne, that he was retiring from the format. He ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper: 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, six hundreds, and just under 300 dismissals. ",
            "Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they got to the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup. A year later they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited the home T20 World Cup in the semi-final, though Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings, and showing electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners. He eventually played on till the 2019 World Cup (but gave up the white-ball captaincy in January 2017). ",
            "India's defeat to New Zealand in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup turned out to be Dhoni's final international, although that wasn't officially confirmed till more than a year later, when after Covid brought sport to a halt, he announced it on Instagram just as players' preparations for that year's delayed IPL began.",
            "In that tournament, Dhoni has been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise, inspiring fierce cult fandom. When Super Kings were reinstated in 2018 after two seasons out serving a suspension, he was back at the helm, leading the team to a fairy-tale third title, and he almost repeated the feat in 2019, when CSK lost a thrilling final against Mumbai Indians by just one run. Dhoni led them to their third title win in 2021, and repeated the feat in 2023, making CSK the league's most successful franchise, alongside Mumbai. \n"

            "Marlon Samuels is a right-hander of immense ability, who has so far struggled to realise his potential, thanks to the various controversies he has been embroiled in. When he started his Test career at 19, without yet representing his native Jamaica in a first-class match, his composure and skill prompted comparisons - quite unfairly - with Viv Richards. His technique was near to faultless, and he exudes a bull-headed confidence - he used to skip his schoolwork on the basis that exams were irrelevant to future Test cricketers.",
            "However, that confidence, which often overflowed into perceived arrogance, has landed him in plenty of trouble. It almost got him sent home from India late in 2002 after he defied a team curfew - but he was kept on, and responded with his a disciplined maiden Test century in Kolkata. His lack of consistency meant he remained an irregular member of the team in the 2000s, but just before his selection for the 2007 World Cup, he was drawn into a major controversy after Nagpur police alleged that he passed on match-related information to an alleged bookie ahead of an ODI against India. He was included in the World Cup squad despite the ICC's investigations into the issue, where he only briefly shone, ending the tournament by running out Brian Lara in his last international innings.",
            "He was called for the World Twenty20 in South Africa in 2007, but the match-fixing allegations reared its head in 2008 when he was found guilty of \"receiving money, or benefit or other reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute.\" Samuels was subsequently banned for two years, at a time when West Indies desperately needed solidity in their middle-order. He returned to the West Indies Test and ODI teams in 2011, but it was only on the tour to England in 2012 that he finally showed what he was capable of. Against a top-class bowling attack in difficult conditions, Samuels scored 386 runs in five innings, with a century and three fifties, defying the England bowlers every time with his correct technique and classy strokeplay. Later that year came a highlight of his career: a gutsy, snappy 78 in the World Twenty20 final against Sri Lanka, which lifted West Indies out of a hole and to their first world title since the 1979 World Cup.",
            "A month after the World T20 triumph, Samuels notched up his first Test double-century, scoring 260 against Bangladesh in Khulna. Consistency eluded him, however, as the big scores were often followed by dips in form and injuries. A facial injury suffered during the Big Bash League in January 2013 ruled him out of West Indies' limited-overs tour to Australia. He picked up a four-for on his return to international cricket against Zimbabwe but his batting form did not improve. Samuels scored just two international hundreds, both in ODIs, in the two seasons following the double-hundred and his lack of form in Tests, and competitions like the World T20, only contributed further to West Indies' struggles. As a result of his poor form, he was dropped after just one Test in the home series against New Zealand in June 2014. ",
            "Samuels, who is a handy part-time offspinner, was reported for a suspect action during the second Test against India in Mumbai in November 2013, along with offspinner Shane Shillingford. Following a biomechanical analysis of his action, Samuels was barred from bowling quicker deliveries in international cricket in December 2013."

All of this, though, was tempered with an iffy technique against the short ball, which was exploited mercilessly in Test cricket and meant Raina's Test career never reached the heights his limited-overs career did, despite starting promisingly.",
            "Raina was prodigious at the under-19 level, his run-scoring and a string of double-hundreds taking him to the Indian junior team and beyond it, to India colours. It took Raina five years to cement his place as an India regular, moving from being a limited-overs specialist who played 98 ODIs to one who became the 12th Indian to make a Test century on debut. ",
            "Raina made his Test debut in Sri Lanka as a replacement for injured team-mate Yuvraj Singh, who, like Raina, was a left-hander, a dasher, and in the early 2000s, India's most athletic fielder. For a while it seemed Raina might have earned a long-term Test spot, but in England in 2011 his lack of skill against pace, seam and swing again opened up debates about his ability to be a consistent Test player for India.",
            "In the shorter versions, though, there're no doubts about his talent. The ability to split the field and discover gaps where fielders could not be placed earned him high praise when he first burst through to play for India in December 2006. The early years weren't so prolific, which led to his omission from the 2007 World Cup.

Mumbai Indians weren't paying $750,000 (plus an undisclosed amount to break a tie with three other franchises) for Pollard's international record; they were shelling out all that money for the fearsome hitting power he had shown in domestic T20 action - most notably while smashing 54 off 18 balls for T&T against New South Wales during the 2009 Champions League T20.",
            "That IPL auction signaled a shift in the world game and, in the months ahead, Pollard continued to show how much ground franchise cricket had gained on the international game. He opted out of the West Indies A team in order to play T20s for Somerset and then refused a WICB central contract, since signing it would mean making himself available at all times for West Indies.",
            "Over the next few years, Pollard improved his international record, scoring a pair of half-centuries at the 2011 World Cup and then, later that year, breaking his century duck by slamming a 110-ball 119 in a crisis situation against India in Chennai. There were plenty of explosive T20 finishes as well, including a 15-ball 38 that put the 2012 World T20 semi-final well beyond Australia's reach.",
            "But through it all, the canvas of franchise cricket remained the best medium to showcase the hulking Pollard's unbridled hitting - with his top hand frequently slipping off the bat handle even as the ball disappeared far over wide long-on - and canny medium-pace. Mumbai retained Pollard after his first season for them and he rewarded their faith in his abilities with, among other match-winning performances, an unbeaten 32-ball 60 that gave them their maiden IPL title.",
            "Though widely considered a limited-overs specialist, Pollard has expressed a desire to play Test cricket, and has a fairly good first-class record behind him, including a whirlwind 126 on debut for Trinidad and Tobago against Barbados. But that call-up has yet to materialise.",
            "Pollard was left out of West Indies' ODI team in December 2014, ahead of a series in South Africa. His axing - along with Darren Sammy and Dwayne Bravo - came soon after West Indies pulled out of their tour of India with an ODI, a T20 and three Tests still remaining, due to a dispute with the board and the players' association over payment structures.

            "Born in Mardan, where the standard of batsmanship will always be measured by arguably Pakistan's greatest Test batsman Younis Khan, Fakhar Zaman has been on Pakistan's thankless domestic circuit for over five years with almost no attention. A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt.",
            "However, his prolific form earned him a contract in the PSL with the Lahore Qalandars. He showed flashes of the class he'd been displaying domestically, particularly during a 33-ball 56 against Karachi where he destroyed the opposition bowling and looked extremely elegant while doing so. It earned him a call-up to Pakistan's T20I side for the West Indies tour, and he made his debut in the second match in Port of Spain."

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. ",

As wicketkeeper and flowing right-hand batsman, Mendis won the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2013, for his work in the Prince of Wales College team.

            "An attractive opening batsman with strokes all around the ground, Lendl Simmons is one of a number of globetrotting T20 specialists from the West Indies. While he has only managed a brief and disappointing Test career, he has shown his value as a limited-overs player for West Indies, particularly in the shortest format, and has also forged a successful career for various franchises around the world including Mumbai Indians, Brisbane Heat and Karachi Kings. ",
            "Simmons, the nephew of the former West Indies allrounder Phil, was handed his international debut in late 2006, during an ODI series in Pakistan, and scored 70 in his second match. It was to be his only half-century in his first nine international innings, however, and he was soon left out of the side. ",
            "He returned in March 2009, this time making his Test debut, having forced his way back by scoring 282 in a first-class game for West Indies A against the touring England XI. His returns, however, were poor: the last of the eight Tests he has played so far came in October 2011, and his 16 innings have only yielded a highest score of 49. ",
            "But he has enjoyed happier times in the limited-overs formats. ODI highlights include the 792 runs he scored in 2011, at 49.50, including a maiden century and eight fifties, and the start he enjoyed to the 2015 World Cup, with an 84-ball 102 against Ireland followed by a 46-ball 50 against Pakistan. In T20Is, he has been a frequent source of brisk runs anywhere in the top four. He has been one of the most consistent overseas players in the IPL, and topped Mumbai's run-charts with 540 runs at 45.00, helping the team clinch the IPL title in 2015. ",
            "Simmons played a brief but vital role in West Indies' title run at the 2016 World T20. Initially ruled out of the tournament with a back injury, he got his chance thanks to a hamstring injury suffered by Andre Fletcher just before the semi-finals. Having arrived in the country only a day-and-a-half earlier, he scored an unbeaten 51-ball 82 at the Wankhede Stadium - his home ground in the IPL - to make short work of India's total of 192 and steer West Indies into the final.

            "If there was any doubt over the value of Jason Roy to England's limited-overs team - and there probably shouldn't have been - it was dispelled on the way to their World Cup triumph of 2019.",
            "Having started the tournament in formidable form - he made a half-century against South Africa and a brutal 153 against Bangladesh - he suffered a hamstring injury against West Indies and could only watch-on as England suffered tournament-threatening defeats against Sri Lanka and Australia.",
            "Rushed back into the side - there was little evidence that he had fully recovered - Roy responded with three typically domineering half-centuries (innings of 66, 60 and 85) and three century partnerships with the equally prolific Jonny Bairstow in what were effectively knock-out games against India, New Zealand and Australia. By the end of that Australia game - the World Cup semi-final - Roy had registered three centuries and six half-centuries in his previous 11 ODI innings. Ben Stokes' brilliance understandably stole the headlines in the final, but there was no way England were reaching that stage without the remarkable consistency of Roy and Bairstow. Going into the final, the pair had recorded four century stands in succession (a record for a single tournament) and 11 in 32 ODIs. And they had the highest strike-rates in history of opening batsmen with more than 1,000 ODI runs to their name.",
            "The swaggering strokeplay of Roy became a central feature of England's limited-overs cricket after their miserable display in the 2015 World Cup insisted that a more adventurous approach was essential. For Roy, a Surrey opener of dashing disposition, such a change of emphasis was ideal. Under the leadership of Eoin Morgan, adamant that England must play free-spirited cricket, Roy found his voice, making his maiden ODI hundred in the UAE in late 2015 before adding two more at home to Sri Lanka the following summer - including 162, at the time the second-highest ODI score made by an England batsman, in front of his adoring home crowd at The Oval.",
            "There was even better to come. In banishing the blues of an Ashes Test thrashing in 2017-18, Roy surpassed Alex Hales' record one-day score for England of 171 (Hales had himself gone past Robin Smith in 2016) with 180 in Melbourne as Australia recognised an England one-day side performing with a freedom of expression that surpassed anything they could muster in response. This was far removed from the batsman who had endured such a dud season in Australia's Big Bash competition.",
            "Born in South Africa, Roy came to the UK aged 10 and soon started to move through the system. He was a hugely successful schoolboy cricketer for Whitgift, and made his Surrey debut as a 17-year-old in 2008 during the Twenty20 Cup and his fielding talents were noticed by England, who used him as a sub later that summer against South Africa. It wasn't until 2010 that he broke into the first team again. He promptly thumped 101 off 57 balls against Kent at Beckenham, Surrey's first T20 hundred. Later in the summer he struck an unbeaten 76 from 65 balls against Leicestershire on Championship debut. England's selectors gave him a place on the Performance Programme tour to India before the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka in early 2012.",
            "Roy's obvious ability in the shorter formats led to him twice winning T20 contracts in the Bangladesh Premier League but he struggled to build on a quietly impressive role in Surrey's 2011 promotion campaign, when he made his maiden first-class hundred. In 2013, he made two YB40 centuries - doubling his List A tally - but struggled badly in Championship cricket, scoring just 49 runs in seven innings.",
            "It was in 2014 that Roy made the leap from a prodigiously talented but erratic young cricketer to a consistent match-winner. The transformation was particularly evident in the NatWest T20 Blast, where he struck 677 runs at 48.35 apiece - the highest tally in the competition. England's T20 competition had undeniably produced an exciting batsman of international quality. Roy's uncomplicated clean-striking became as much a feature of Friday nights at The Oval as the beer-snakes and streakers. With his breathtaking power down the ground and penchant for switch-hitting - not to mention the fact he was born in South Africa - he was frequently compared to Kevin Pietersen, not least by Pietersen himself. His brilliance did not achieve the same levels in the following two summers - how could it? - but a destructive hundred against Somerset in 2015, and against Kent the following year, was a reminder of his unfettered talent.",
            "After working hard on pacing his innings in four-day cricket, Roy also blossomed in Championship cricket in 2014, hitting 1078 runs, the highest at the club, at an average of 50-plus without reigning in his destructiveness: his strike rate was still 84. He also averaged 47.65 in the Championship in a promotion year in 2015, his strike rate even higher.  ",
            "By the summer's end, he was rewarded with a T20 international debut against India and in 2015 he became a fixture in England's limited-overs formats, building on a couple of promising 60s against Australia with a maiden ODI ton against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, an innings that was rarely fluent - and that was entirely overshadowed by Jos Buttler's dash to his own hundred in record time - but one that provided proof of a growing survival mentality.",
            "After a breakthrough year in international cricket, which included helping England to the World T20 final, he won a maiden IPL contract for the 2017 tournament. But spending most of his time sitting in the dugout for Gujarat Lions was not productive and his form faltered ahead of the 2017 Champions Trophy. He had failed to pass 20 in nine ODI innings and was eventually dropped from England's side for the semi-final (which they lost), but he rebounded well in the late-September ODIs against West Indies after Hales' night out in Bristol cost him his spot. ",
            "The crowd-pleasing innings soon began to occur with increasing regularity, as one half of a prolific opening partnership with Jonny Bairstow that embodied the devil-may-care approach of an exciting England side that found itself top of the ODI rankings. As well as the Melbourne 180 (which also included a record-breaking 221 stand for the third wicket with Joe Root), there were further hundreds against Australia in Cardiff and Chester-le-Street in 2018; followed by two more, against West Indies and Pakistan, in the lead-up to the World Cup, pushing his average above 40 and leading to increased calls for him to be considered for the Ashes to follow later in 2019.",
            "He was unable to replicate such dominance when that Test call came. Despite an innings of 72 made from No. 3 on debut (England had utilised a nightwatchman) against Ireland, the somewhat puzzling decision to use him as an opening batsman - a role he had long since abandoned for Surrey; indeed, he had never batted for two complete sessions in a first-class game - exposed issues against the moving ball. In four Ashes Tests, he averaged just 13.75 with a best of 31. By the time he was demoted to No. 4, his confidence looked to have been eroded and he was dropped ahead of the final Test at The Oval.",
            "That he was unable to become a dual World Cup winner as part of England's triumph in 2022's T20 World Cup was due to a dire run of form that summer. He was omitted from the 15-man squad after scoring just 78 (at an average of 12.66) across six home T20Is, continuing that lean run in The Hundred with 51 across six knocks for Oval Invincibles. Nevertheless, he re-emerged at the start of 2023 with ODI centuries against South Africa and Bangladesh to rubberstamp his 50-over spot ahead of the title defence later in the year."

Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed.",

But from the moment that he delivered an emotional maiden Test century in Cape Town, where his father had strong off-season links, he began to make a significant mark with England. Nothing could compare with his impact on the one-day team, where his peerless opening partnership with Jason Roy helped deliver England a first World Cup success in 2019.",

An early starter with Yorkshire's Under-15s, he was named Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year in 2007, having already played for Yorkshire's 2nd XI and their Academy side and represented England Under-17. He soon followed in his father's footsteps by signing a full-time contract with Yorkshire. Jonny was eight-years-old when his father took his own life. Merely to play the game, and for the same county, was courageous enough.",
            "He made an impressive first-class debut against Somerset in June 2009, cracking 82 in his second innings, and soon secured his place in the first XI. Further honours followed when he was picked up by England's Performance Programme and included in the England Lions successful tour of the Caribbean in January 2011.",
            "By now Yorkshire's first-choice keeper, he registered his maiden first-class hundred against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May of that year. Having previously passed fifty 17 times in 34 first-class matches without reaching three figures, just to emphasise his breakthrough, he made it a double. During his brilliant attacking innings, he was joined by England's recently retired opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom in a record ninth-wicket partnership for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire (which had stood since 1899) of 151. Bairstow and Sidebottom were sons of two of Yorkshire's best-loved former players - the passing of talent between the generations could not have been more satisfactorily captured.",
            "Many suspected that, long term, Bairstow would become a specialist batter and his debut innings in one-day internationals backed up that theory as he hit an unbeaten 41 off 21 balls against India at Cardiff. A tough India tour showed the realities of international cricket but he bounced back with a match-winning 60 off 46 in a T20I against Pakistan in the UAE and, after a strong start to the 2012 season, he was handed a call-up to the Test squad to face West Indies.",
            "It was not a happy series for Bairstow, whose problems against some hostile short bowling from Kemar Roach gained much media attention. He was left out of the opening Test of the South Africa series but, after Kevin Pietersen was dropped in extraordinary circumstances, another opportunity arose for Bairstow to which he responded magnificently. His brilliant 95 at Lord's led an England fightback from 54 for 4, Bairstow emerging from a short-ball peppering to play some fluent attacking shots in an innings former England captain Michael Vaughan said would have been the finest maiden Test century he had witnessed had his fellow Yorkshireman not been bowled by Morne Morkel.",
            "He played all five of England's games at the World T20 that winter, averaging just 9.50, and his participation in the India Test series was also limited before he was granted leave to return home because of a family illness. Thereafter his bit-part status congealed - he lost his spot in the T20 team and, after returning to the Test team during the Ashes as England dropped Nick Compton and moved Joe Root up the order, he was abruptly left out at The Oval. A squad member for the return tour of Australia, he played in the last two Tests, replacing the out-of-form Matt Prior, but did not unearth the performances to promote his worth as Prior's long-term successor and had to buckle down to the county circuit the following summer.",
            "That 2015 season promised to be the making of him as he struck 1108 first-class runs at 92.33, allowed by Yorkshire to play as he saw fit. Nothing was more emphatic than his 366-run alliance with Tim Bresnan at Chester-le-Street, both players making career-bests in Yorkshire's fifth-highest stand of all time. England were receptive. A combative 83 not out at Chester-le-Street after a late summons settled a weather-hit ODI against New Zealand in England's favour and the faltering form of Buttler brought a Test recall against Australia.",
            "It was Cape Town, though, where Bairstow really broke through, as the summer of 2016 testified. Bairstow's second Test ton was reserved for his home crowd against Sri Lanka: 140, batting at No. 7, out of 298. On a challenging surface, he played with a certainty not given to others. England's top order was repeatedly found wanting in Test cricket, but the belligerence of Bairstow and co down the order constantly dug them out of a hole, and another hundred at Lord's followed.",
            "His desire was relentless and his growing impact in ODIs was enough for him to return at the top of the order in the Champions Trophy semi-final - a defeat against Pakistan in Cardiff. West Indies felt his frustration at the end of the summer in the form of his first two ODI hundreds.",
            "But even as he became increasingly integral to England's white-ball fortunes, vagaries of selection hurt his Test chances. He scored an Ashes hundred on the 2017-18 tour and another in Christchurch a few months later, but pushed up the order to cover for deficiencies in others, his form dipped; he lost the gloves to Ben Foakes due to injury in Sri Lanka - though scored a bristling century when asked to bat as a specialist at No. 3 - and then saw the role handed to Buttler following a 2-2 draw in the 2019 Ashes."

            "Mushfiqur captained in the Under-19 World Cup in February 2006, and featured in a Test in Bogra (that venue's first) against Sri Lanka the following month, though he could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara. His first Test fifty came on the return tour of Sri Lanka the following year. Earlier in 2007, he was picked as the first-choice wicketkeeper, ahead of Khaled Mashud, for the World Cup in the West Indies - where he starred in Bangladesh's landmark defeat of India, anchoring the chase of 192 with 56 not out.",
            "Mushfiqur came into his own as a Test batter in the 2010s, stepping up to No. 4, shedding the image of lower-order scrapper, taking on the mantle of dependable mainstay, and proving himself one of the better players of spin in the Bangladesh line-up. His first hundred, the fastest by a Bangladesh batter then, came against India in Chattogram in 2010, and was followed two Tests later by 72 and 95 against England at the same venue. ",
            "After defeats on the Test and white-ball legs of the series in Zimbabwe in 2011, he was appointed captain in place of Shakib Al Hasan, a role he served in for 94 internationals, through to 2018 - though the white-ball part of his tenure lasted only till 2014. Highlights of his term included a first-time place in the Asia Cup final in 2012 and a whitewash of Zimbabwe in a Test series at home in 2014.",
            "In 2013, Mushfiqur produced a double-century against Sri Lanka in Galle in a Bangladesh total of 638, their highest. In 2017, there were back-to-back hundreds against New Zealand and India away - though they could not fend off defeats. In Mirpur in 2018 and 2020, he scored double-hundreds against Zimbabwe in back-to-back Tests against them 15 months apart; the first of those made him the first wicketkeeper-batter to score two Test double-hundreds. His favourite opponents, though, have been Sri Lanka, against whom he averages over 50 - boosted, most recently, by consecutive hundreds in the 2022 home series. Against them in 2017, he became the first Bangladesh wicketkeeper to get to 100 dismissals in Tests.",
            "Mushfiqur became the first to play 100 games in the BPL, in 2023. He has been among the leading run-scorers in the tournament for a number of years since the league kicked off, turning out for Rajshahi Royals and Khulna Tigers most often.\n"

            "Coetzer also forged a solid county career with Durham and Northamptonshire. His beakthrough season came in 2007 when he began by hitting his maiden first-class hundred, 153 not out from just 150 balls against Durham UCCE, Coetzer enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2007, playing a key role in Durham's success. He finished the season with an average of 38 as Durham finished second in the County Championship, and a fresh-faced batsman in an experienced dressing room he also struck a 74-ball 61 against Hampshire at Lord's as Durham secured their first ever silverware in the Friends Provident Trophy.",
            "However, Coetzer proved unable to fulfil his early promise at Durham. In 2011, a move to Northants - initially on loan - rejuvenated him, and he emerged as an important member of their side, striking a double century against Leicestershire. His 2015 season, though, following as it did the thrill of a Woirld Cup campaign with Scotand, was singularly unsuccessful and proved to be his last.",
            "Coetzer became part of Scotland's set-up when he played in the European Under-15 Championship in 1999, eventually establishing himself as a crucial member of the Scotland top order. He was their leading run scorer at the 2009 World Twenty20, with 75 runs at 37.50 against New Zealand and South Africa. In 2013 he registered his maiden ODI century, 133, against Afghanistan.",
            "He became Scotland's captain in 2013, but he lost the role to Preston Mommsen, who stood in when Coetzer was injured during Scotland's successful qualifying campaign for the 2015 World Cup and who kept the role on their preparation tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2014. If Coetzer was disappointed he did not let it show. He scored 333 runs at 55.50 apiece on the World Cup acclimatisation tour, the highest tally of any player from the four World Cup qualifiers, and was named as Mommsen's vice-captain in Scotland's World Cup squad.  ",
            "He finished as Scotland's leading run-scorer with 253 runs at 42.16 including that 156 against Bangladesh in Nelson, which led Scotland to 318, their highest World Cup score but failed to bring them the victory they had yearned for. Things took a turn for the worse after that: he was briefly omitted from the World T20 qualifiers, which Cricket Scotland blamed on a breakdown in communication at a time when he was struggling to prolong his county career.

            "A prolific, elegant and utterly classy batsman with a huge appetite for runs, and a calm yet authoritative captain - those are the qualities that best describe Mahela Jayawardene. His sheer quality as a batsman was never in doubt even when he just entered the international scene, but for Jayawardene the biggest challenge has been to justify all the early hype. With over 10,000 runs in both Tests and ODIs - and a captaincy stint that included a World Cup final appearance - it can safely be said that he has met that challenge more than adequately.",
            "Blessed with excellent hand-eye coordination and a fine technique, Jayawardene scores his runs all around the wicket. Among his favourite strokes are the languid cover-drive - often with minimal footwork but precise placement and timing - and the wristy flick off his legs, but there are several others he plays with equal felicity. The most memorable are the cuts and dabs he plays behind the stumps, mostly off spinners, but also against quick bowling, when bat makes contact with ball delightfully late. Apart from his artistry, what stands out about his batting is his hunger for big scores, most apparent in his record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara, but also in the regularity with which he notches up Test double-hundreds. And his century against Zimbabwe in the World Twenty20 in 2010 was a shining example of traditional methods succeeding in a new format.",
            "Jayawardene is easily one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, but the major drawback in his career is his relative lack of success in overseas conditions. His averages in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are all less than 35, but at home he averages more than 60.",
            "In the second half of his career, Jayawardene grew into an astute captain who read the game well and wasn't afraid to take risks. Under him, Sri Lanka shed their diffident approach, winning Tests in England and New Zealand, and - in what was Jayawardene's greatest achievement as captain - reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He quit captaincy in February 2009, but agreed to a second stint, taking over from Tillakaratne Dilshan after the tour to South Africa in 2011-12, but resigned again after a year, handing the reins to Angelo Mathews.

He was Pakistan's first T20I century-maker, getting there off 58 balls against Bangladesh in the 2014 T20 World Cup. Later that year he mixed aggression and watchfulness to make a Test-best 176, against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi. He was also only the fourth Pakistan batter to make five ODI hundreds as an opener, taking only 43 innings to get there, where Sohail took 132 innings. ",

He had attractive shots, but more often than not they went straight to the fielder. And then there were the behavioural issues. He was left out of the probables squad for the 2016 tour of England on disciplinary grounds, and coach Mickey Arthur called him and Umar Akmal a \"disruption to the team\". In 2014, Shehzad was reprimanded for getting into an on-field discussion involving religion with Tillakaratne \nDilshan, and in 2018, he failed a drugs test, was banned and had the ban extended after it was found that he had played club cricket during his suspension.

His Kolpak deal had expired by then and he was selected in South Africa's one-day squad for the home series against India in January 2011. A half-century on debut sealed his spot for the World Cup that followed. At that point, du Plessis was known as an aggressive ball-striker and quick run-scorer.",

Du Plessis spent more than seven-and-a-half hours at the crease, faced 376 balls and remained unbeaten on 110 to take South Africa to an unlikely draw, which set them up for a series win in Perth.",

He was then given the role permanently the following February. Du Plessis had established himself as a complete batsmen, who had the ability to shift gears and anchor an innings, and played a similar knock against India in December 2013. His 134 in the second innings of the Johannesburg Test took South Africa within eight runs of completing the highest successful Test chase, 458, and in the end secured a draw. When Kallis retired after the next match, du Plessis was an automatic choice for promotion to No.3. ",

In his 51st ODI, he finally scored his first century in the format, against Australia in a triangular series in Harare in August 2014, but then the floodgates opened. Two more hundreds came in that series, which South Africa won. ",

            "While du Plessis continued to rack up runs in ODIs, he was criticised for occasionally scoring too slowly. He started to struggle in the longest format and after managing just one fifty in 12 innings in the 2015-16 season, he was dropped for the final Test against England in January 2016. ",

He showed big-match credentials, striking 62 off 46 balls in the semi-final against a Mumbai Indians attack comprising Mitchell Johnson and Harbhajan Singh. The following year, at the Caribbean Premier League, he made 321 runs from eight innings, the most by a T&T Red Steel batsman and only 42 behind Gayle, who had played 11 innings. "

As a batter, he was a broad-chested attacker in the Matthew Hayden mould, blessed with enough power to not have to muscle shots to get them to the rope, and with finesse to boot.",

            "Despite an athletic figure made for photo shoots, Watson's frame was so brittle it threatened to break him. He suffered recurrent back stress fractures, hamstring strains, calf problems, hip complaints, and more in his career, but prevailed, changing his training and giving up alcohol, but not his dream. The sacrifice and effort paid off in 2009, when he was chosen as a Test opener in the middle of the Ashes series. After two scores in the 90s and an 89, he brought up his first Test hundred at the MCG against Pakistan. A productive few years as a Test opener led to back-to-back Allan Border Medals, but then injury interceded again. Though Watson  returned to the team in 2012, he spent the rest of his Test career floating up and down the order in search of a place to call his own.",

            "- Marsh has turned out for five franchises in the IPL - Deccan Chargers, Pune Warriors, Rising Pune Supergiant, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC).",
            "- Marsh was first picked in 2010 by Chargers as a 19-year-old. He managed just 28 runs in three games and picked up two wickets. Warriors then splurged US$290,000 for Marsh in the 2011 auction. He played two seasons for Warriors in 2011 and 2013 (he missed the 2012 season because of a back injury). ",
            "- Between 2014 and 2021, Marsh was part of the IPL in just two seasons. He played three games for Supergiant in 2016, and then a solitary match for SRH in 2020 before getting injured. ",

He has been an alluring prospect for Australia but has struggled to cement his place at international level despite some outstanding performances on the big stage.",
            "Marsh was earmarked for high honours, alongside his brother Shaun, ever since he captained Australia Under-19s to victory in the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He played state cricket at just 17, and made his T20I debut at 19 in 2011. He was also a promising junior Australian Rules footballer, and hails from a prolific sporting family - his father is Geoff Marsh, the Australia opener, and later coach and selector; his sister, Melissa, was a professional basketballer.",
            "In 2018, Marsh was appointed Australia Test vice-captain in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal, but he was then dropped from all formats and lost his national contract due to a string of failures, at Test level in particular. In 2020 he returned to the T20I fold and the following year, starred on two tours of West Indies and Bangladesh and produced a stunning 77 not out off 50 balls in the T20 World Cup final, helping Australia to their maiden title.  ",
            "Marsh made it to the Test side over Shane Watson on the 2015 Ashes tour and was given time to settle into the No. 6 role, although his bowling was arguably the stronger feature of his game at the time. That had not been the case in his debut Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE the previous year, when he scored 87 and 47 in his second Test. He never quite settled until a big century at the WACA in the third Test of the 2017-18 Ashes. He followed that with another, in Sydney - brought up amid emotional scenes with his brother at the crease - and then made a pivotal match-winning 96 in a Test win in Durban before Australian cricket plunged into crisis.",
            "It was the start of a period of decline for Marsh too. He only played one Test during the 2018-19 home summer, failing twice with the bat against India at the MCG. He returned as part of the Ashes squad in 2019, at The Oval, where he took his maiden five-wicket haul. Later that year, he broke his hand thumping the dressing-room wall at the WACA following a dismissal in the Sheffield Shield, disrupting his career again.",
            "He stormed back into Test contention in the 2023 Ashes after four years out of the side, replacing injured allrounder Cameron Green and producing a boundary-studded 118 at Headingley, were it not for which, Australia might have lost more emphatically than they did. In the Old Trafford Test that followed, he made a fifty and held out with a teeth-gritted 31 made over two and a half hours on the final day to secure the series as England threatened to blow Australia's house down. ",
            "In the BBL, Marsh has turned out most often for powerhouse side Perth Scorchers, winning three titles with them. "

A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion.",

The injury had been so severe that amputation was considered an option in the initial diagnosis. Ervine's recovery from the injury focused his ambitions, and mid-way through his A level studies at Lomagundi College on the outskirts of Chinhoyi he won a place at the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy. Ervine soon found his way into the Midlands, and Zimbabwe Under-19 and A sides before heading to England to expand his horizons and improve his game.",
            "After spells with English clubs Bexhill and Lordhood, and a stint with Irish club Lisburn in Belfast, Ervine returned to Zimbabwe and took up a contract with Masvingo-based franchise Southern Rocks. Ervine was their leading run-scorer in the 2009-10 Logan Cup and topped their one-day averages as well. His returns in the domestic Twenty20 competition were more modest, but a call-up to Zimbabwe's squad for the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean followed. "

Variety is his calling and as well as a traditional leg-break, he has two googlies, a conventional offie and a lethal faster one, though this is increasingly rare. All come with the threat of considerable, late drift. He fairly hustles through overs, which in limited-over formats is a weapon in itself and the package is dangerous.",
            "But forever associated with him will be his madcap batting, the prospect of which is a crowd-puller the world over. He is a compulsive basher, literally unable to control his urges to slog every ball that comes his way, and not much of it is classical. Often spectacular results are at hand; he owns, for example, two of the fastest ODI hundreds, including the fastest one ever in his first innings ever at the age of 16. His career strike rates are nearly unmatched. But mostly, anywhere in the order, consistency has been missing.",
            "Despite a healthy Test career, he gave up on the format in 2006, pre-empting men such as Andrew Flintoff, to maximise fully a limited-overs career. He came back, in inimitable fashion, for one Test only, as captain no less in 2010. A loss and two slogs meant he re-retired immediately after. Twenty20 is something he could've been made for and he is among the most lethal players of the format, having been player of the tournament for the inaugural edition of the World Twenty20 in 2007 and led Pakistan to the title two years later with matchwinning all-round hands in the semi and final."

The left-handers that had preceded him, like Arjuna Ranatunga and Asanka Gurusinha, had been pugnacious battlers but Sangakkara was cut from more graceful cloth, easing into strokes with the elegance often associated withthose that play with the 'other' hand. The cut and the pull came naturally to him and with growing confidence, he became a more assured front-foot player as well.",

Initially, his glovework wasn't for the purists, but such was his batting ability that there was no question of displacing him from the XI.",
            "As a batsman, he has matured steadily, and the appetite for runs was best illustrated at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo in 2006, when he and Mahela Jayawardene, captain and close friend, added 624 against a South African attack boasting Dale Steyn and Makhaya Ntini. Sangakkara contributed 287 and did his burgeoning reputation no harm a year later when he went to Hobart and scored a dazzling 192 in a close defeat. By then, he already had a half-century in a World Cup final to his name, and long before Jayawardene relinquished the captaincy, it was understood that Sangakkara would be the anointed one.",

With the captain's burden on his shoulders, he no longer keeps in Test matches, but the smart-alec remarks from behind the stumps are a common feature of every game that Sri Lanka plays in coloured clothes.",
            "Although leadership drew the best from him as a batsman, he remains a voracious no. 3 in all forms despite having relinquished the reins in 2011. Sangakkara won the top prize at 2012's ICC awards, in addition to the award for Test Cricketer of the Year and the People's Choice award for the second year running. Later that year he confirmed himself among batting's modern greats, by becoming the equal fastest man to 10,000 Test runs alongside Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara, with the biggest Test crowd Sri Lanka had ever played for in audience, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

            "A robust batting technique, nagging consistency with the ball, athleticism in the field, and an imperturbable temperament made Angelo Mathews one of Sri Lanka's most prized assets, although persistent injuries and several standoffs with the Sri Lankan board prevented him from achieving his full potential.",
            "In limited-overs cricket, Mathews' all-round skills have been indispensable. When he pulled a quad in the World Cup semi-final in 2011, it forced three changes to the XI that played in the final, as the team strove for the balance he could single-handedly deliver. ",
            "He began his international career with ambitions of becoming a genuine allrounder, but over time came to give primacy to his batting, effectively playing as a specialist batter in the Test side, providing solidity to the lower-middle order. Against Pakistan in December 2013, he batted for seven and a half hours to make an unbeaten 157 (having already scored 91 in the first innings) and save a Test in Abu Dhabi. ",
            "Mathews had an outstanding 2014, in which he scored 1160 Test runs at an average of 77.33, his finest moment being a rousing 160 at Headingley, which transformed that match and saw Sri Lanka win their first Test series in England (not including the one-off Test in 1998). He had also starred in Sri Lanka's victorious T20 World Cup campaign earlier that year, scoring 40 off 23 balls in the semi-final against West Indies and conceding only 25 runs for a wicket in the final against India.",
            "He took over the captaincy in 2013, leading Sri Lanka to the series win in England, but after an embarrassing ODI series loss at home to Zimbabwe in 2017 and an early Asia Cup exit in 2018, Mathews found himself dropped from the one-day team altogether, specifically for his running between the wickets.",
            "He batted for over seven hours to save the Wellington Test in December 2018, dropping on to the pitch after getting to his hundred to do ten push-ups and then flexing his biceps to let his coach know what he thought of being called cricket-unfit. He tore a hamstring in the next Test and was ruled out for four months. As if that wasn't enough drama, Mathews took a wicket off his first ball in the 2019 World Cup, not having bowled for eight months before that.",
            "Despite the many injuries in the second half of his career, Mathews reached the 100-Tests milestone in 2022, becoming the 12th man to be dismissed for 199 in a Test in the process.\n"

            "- Hardik Pandya is part of a rare species in Indian cricket - a genuine seam-bowling allrounder - and he was unearthed by Mumbai Indians (MI) in IPL 2015.",
            "- Hardik spent his first seven IPL seasons at Mumbai, developing into one of the world's best allrounders, and was part of their title wins in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020. After injuries began to hinder his ability to bowl, Hardik was released by Mumbai after the 2021 season.",
            "- Ahead of IPL 2022, Hardik was signed by new franchise Gujarat Titans (GT) and was appointed their captain even though he had never led any team previously. In his first season as captain, Hardik led Titans to the IPL title and then captained them to the final once again in IPL 2023.",
            "- After two successful years at Titans, Hardik was traded back to Mumbai ahead of IPL 2024, and he was appointed MI captain, replacing long-time leader Rohit Sharma.",
            "- Hardik's best season as an allrounder was in IPL 2019, when he scored 402 runs at a strike rate of 191.41 and took 14 wickets in Mumbai's title-winning campaign. In 2022, he was the highest run-scorer (487) for Titans as they won their maiden IPL title.",
            "Allrounder Hardik Pandya's calling cards brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking marked by the ability to hit sixes from the first ball. ",
            "Hardik, who plays his domestic cricket for Baroda, first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2015 IPL. That began a long association with Mumbai, where he won four trophies and gained acclaim as a formidable finisher. By the end of the 2022 T20 World Cup, he had come to be seen as a future India captain, thanks to the leadership skills he showed that year in turning an unfancied Gujarat Titans line-up into IPL champions in their first year of existence. ",
            "Hardik began his India career in 2016 when he was called up for a limited-overs tour to Australia, before impressing with the ball on seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. He appeared to be the answer to India's search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly fielding added to the mix, he sealed his spot in India's squad for that year's T20 World Cup. ",
            "While Hardik batted only twice in the tournament, he bowled the last over against Bangladesh, defending two runs off three balls to help India to a one-run win. A little more than a week after that, Pandya endured the disappointment of bowling a no-ball to reprieve Lendl Simmons, whose unbeaten innings helped eventual champions West Indies clinch the semi-final.",
            "Since then, it has not been all smooth sailing. The impact of a serious back injury in 2018 continues to follow Hardik, sometimes limiting him from being able to bowl. And early in 2019, he was embroiled in controversy when he made misogynistic and racist remarks on a talk show, for which he was pulled up by the Indian board.",
            "In the 2020s, Hardik grew into his role as a senior player and won praise for his faith in players as a captain and for being a free-thinker. In 2022, after India beat Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, he said he wouldn't have minded losing because the match was so much fun - sentiments he echoed after the 2023 IPL final, where he was all praise for rival captain MS Dhoni, whose Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans for the title. That year, like in the one before, Hardik turned in an impressive all-round and captaincy performance, making 346 runs and taking nine wickets in Gujarat Titans' run to their second final in a row."

            "An allrounder with plenty of flair and skill both as a batter and seam bowler, Dwayne Bravo will go down as one of T20's early legends - he played seven World Cups in the format, winning two, as well as over 15 franchise league titles, and was the first bowler to get to 500 T20 wickets.",
            "He grew up wanting to be the next Brian Lara, but eventually made his name in the shortest format, particularly for his death-overs bowling and big hitting. Bravo might have had a longer career with West Indies in the other formats, but injuries, disagreements with the board, and the explosion of franchise cricket limited his appearances to 40 Tests and 164 ODIs. ",
            "He made his Test debut at Lord's in July 2004, and took three wickets in the first innings with his medium-paced swingers. He also showed a cool enough temperament to forge a confident start at the crease with the bat, but nowhere was his ability more evident than in Manchester, where he top-scored for the team, and then restricted England with a six-wicket haul. He hit 107 against South Africa in April 2004-05 at Antigua to bring up his maiden Test century, and in November 2005, scored a magnificent 113 against Australia in Hobart.",
            "In 2010, along with Kieron Pollard, Bravo turned down a WICB central contract that required him to be available to play for West Indies at all times. The next year he chose the IPL over a home series against Pakistan. Between 2011 and 2013, West Indies played 24 Tests but Bravo didn't appear in any of them. He retired from Test cricket in January 2015.",
            "He took over from Daren Sammy as West Indies' limited-overs captain in 2013 and held the post till December 2014, when the selectors replaced him with Jason Holder and left him out of the ODI side two months after he had played a central role in the team pulling out of a tour to India midway over issues with the payment structure in their revised contracts. ",
            "In between, he became a fixture in the Chennai Super Kings line-up in the IPL, topping the tournament wickets table in 2013 and 2015, and replicating that achievement in the CPL in 2015 and 2016, and the BBL in 2017-18.",
            "Bravo announced his international retirement in October 2018 but reversed his decision over a year later in order to defend West Indies' T20 World Cup title. After their early exit in the tournament, he walked away once more, at the age of 38.\n"

            "Playing in just his third ODI, in 2020, Tector produced an ice-cool 29 not out off 26 balls to help secure a famous win chasing 329 with a ball to spare. Paul Stirling's and Andy Balbirnie's hundreds may have taken the headlines on the day, but Tector's poise gave hope that Ireland may have found a cure for the middle-order ills that had plagued them following multiple retirements toward the end of the 2010s. ",
            "After a string of 20s and 30s against lesser opposition, Tector showed signs that he performs better on a bigger stage after he made 79 off 68 balls to help take Ireland to their first ever ODI win over South Africa, in July 2021. Since then, he hasn't looked back, making three fifties in Jamaica in an ODI series win over West Indies to start 2022. That run came in a stretch of nine ODI innings where he made seven scores of over 50, the last two of them hundreds against New Zealand. In between whiles he also made an unbeaten 64 off 33 balls in a rain-shortened T20 against India at Malahide. ",
            "Tector's reputation as a T20 player of value has grown enough that he is one of the few Ireland cricketers able to attract interest on the T20 franchise circuit. He secured a deal with Barbados Royals in the CPL in 2022.\n"

In summer 2013, Cooper joined his brother in the Dutch Topklasse limited-overs competition, and finished as the leading run-scorer that season with 866 runs. He was called up to the national side the same year, making his debut against Canada in the World Cricket League (WCL) Championship. ",

In February, he teamed with Pieter Seelaar for a record 288-run stand for the sixth wicket in an Intercontinental Cup match in Hong Kong to salvage a memorable draw, contributing a Player-of-the-Match 173 not out.

            "Calum MacLeod won a place in Scottish sport folklore when he struck a century that helped Scotland beat the world's No. 1 ODI side at the time, England, in a game in Edinburgh in 2018. That year, he also produced an unbeaten 157 against Afghanistan in a World Cup Qualifier match in Bulawayo, where he expertly dealt with legspinner Rashid Khan, liberally employing a sweep shot that he put down to his time spent playing hockey. Those knocks made him a slam-dunk choice at the end of 2018 to claim the ICC Associate Player of the Year Award, making him the second Scotland player to do so following Preston Mommsen in 2014. ",
            "When MacLeod acted as a substitute fielder for England in an Ashes Test in 2009 he became the first Gaelic speaker to appear in a Test. That year, his hopes of forging a county career as a fast bowler fell apart when his action was reported after an Intercontinental Cup match. Remedial work followed, including sessions with Allan Donald, then bowling coach at Warwickshire, but he was released by the county in 2010. ",
            "Nevertheless, hours spent watching the preparations of Warwickshire's England duo, Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, proved to be of benefit. Cricket Scotland had introduced player contracts at the end of 2008, and gradually MacLeod, who had briefly wondered about taking up hockey, surprised everyone by forcing his way into the side as a batter.",
            "Two MacLeod centuries in succession in January 2014 - a 62-ball 113 against UAE and 175 against Canada - played a major part in Scotland's qualification for the 2015 World Cup. Durham were impressed enough to offer him a contract, as a T20 player first and then across formats, and he helped win them the Royal London One-Day Cup that year. In 2018, Derbyshire signed him up in T20, and they benefited from a 58-ball hundred against Northamptonshire. ",
            "MacLeod's run-making - exactly 4000 runs in List A cricket for Scotland and more than 4300 overall - has often come in bursts: his limited-overs average for Scotland of 32.52 is not in the country's top ten, yet he is comfortably top of the heap when it comes to List A and ODI hundreds made for the side. ",
            "He was in sizzling ODI form over the home summer of 2022, making six scores of 50-plus in nine innings and finishing with an unbeaten hundred against USA at Aberdeen in what would be his final innings on home soil. Seemingly with several prime years left, he retired out of the blue at 33 in November that year, following Scotland's exit from the T20 World Cup in Australia.\n"

All has been well with Yuvraj more often in limited-overs cricket, where he can be effortless and brutal at the same time, than in Tests, though his form and consistency has been on the decline since his comeback following a recovery from a rare form of germ cell cancer in 2012. When he started off, though, his athleticism on the field and his canny left-arm spin made him a key one-day player as Indian cricket went through a makeover at the turn of the century.",
            "Yuvraj's father, Yograj, who played one Test for India, was what Mike Agassi was to Andre. So obsessed was he with Yuvraj's cricket that he took a skating gold medal off his young son's neck and threw it out of the car. \"From now on, you are going to play cricket.\" And from then on he has played cricket. The major shift came when, at 15, he carried kitbags in crowded local trains, living away from his parents and a luxurious life in Punjab. At 18 he was shredding a strong Australian attack, in only his second ODI, in the Champions Trophy in 2000.",
            "Soon Yuvraj would become India's middle-order lynchpin, forming fruitful partnerships first with Rahul Dravid and then with MS Dhoni. Both batsmen, superb ODI operators in their own right, credited their success to Yuvraj's ability to score at will. Testament to Yuvraj's importance is that when he was dropped from the ODI side in 2010, it was the first such occurrence since he cemented his place in the Indian team. His ODI career is full of highlight reels, with the biggest impact being his contribution to India's World Cup triumph in 2011 - 362 runs, 15 wickets, and four Man-of-the-Match awards, and the Player of the Tournament. That put to shade even his awesome achievement in the World T20 triumph in 2007, where he famously hit a Stuart Broad over for six sixes.",
            "However, his limitations have manifested themselves in Tests, where he has struggled both against the seaming and swinging ball, and quality spin. Apart from three shining innings - a sparkling century on a Lahore greentop, another from 61 for 4 against Pakistan, and an unbeaten 85 in a successful chase of 387 in Chennai - his Test career doesn't have much to write home about.",
            "The World Cup win in 2011 was the biggest moment of his cricket career, but soon after that came the biggest challenge of his life, when he was diagnosed cancer which required a two-and-a-half month treatment in the USA. He returned home after completing his chemotherapy in April 2012, fairly confident that he could resume his duties on the cricket field reasonably quickly and in August he was named in India's squad for the World T20 in Sri Lanka.",
            "In January 2013, poor form and fitness led to his ouster from the team. But a visibly slimmer and fitter Yuvraj emerged from a training stint in France in October and hit an unbeaten 35-ball 77 in a T20I against Australia on his comeback. But lack of consistency meant he was out of the ODI mix after the tour of South Africa in December 2013.",
            "Even as his form dipped, Yuvraj continued to be a hot pick at the IPL auction, picking up contracts worth over a million dollars in 2014 ($2.33 million or Rs 14 crore to RCB), 2015 ($2.67 million or Rs 16 crore to Delhi Daredevils) and 2016 ($1.04 million or Rs 7 crore to Sunrisers Hyderabad). The hype surrounding him didn't transcend onto the cricket field, however, and the low point was a laboured 21-ball 11 in the final of the 2014 World T20 which resulted in India losing momentum and eventually the title to Sri Lanka. ",
            "In January 2016, he made yet another international return, in Australia, for the T20 stretch leading into the World T20, where a twisted ankle curtailed his tournament. He hadn't had a great time at the World T20, his 52 runs coming at an average of 13.00 and a strike rate of exactly 100, and at 34, his international future seemed in doubt. "

When he was unceremoniously dumped from England's set up early in 2014, with lawyers at the ready on all sides, he was presented by those in authority as an egotistical individualist whose reluctance to respect those in charge forever undermined attempts to build a strong team ethic. Whatever view you held, Pietersen deserved to be recognised as one of the most captivating cricketers to pull on an England shirt. His flamboyant strokeplay was at the heart of many of England's finest performances for a decade. A brazen belief in his own ability, moments of outrageous unorthodoxy and, at times, a surprising vulnerability on and off the field have all combined to give him great box-office appeal. ",

In 2013, he became the highest England run-scorer in all international forms of the game combined. But Pietersen's ability to command attention on the field has been matched only by his ability to divide opinion off it. After more than nine years and many controversies, Pietersen's England career was at an end, a fact he wrestled with interminably: accepting it one day, holding out hope of a miraculous return the next. He had no choice but to commit himself to the life of a T20 specialist.",
            "For many England cricket fans, no name sparks more excitement. But his celebrity status, individualistic streak and outspoken ways often grated with the England cricket authorities who prefer their star names to be more malleable and conservative. The English media, which has at times been vitriolic - not to say personal - about his rebellious streak has generally recognised that he has few peers.",
            "An attempt to introduce him into the inner sanctum, by appointing him England captain in August 2008, lasted only five months as his relationship with the coach, Peter Moores, was uncomfortable from the outset. Their differences simmered throughout a troubled tour of India and when the rift became public Pietersen was forced to resign early in the New Year with a disenchanted Moores sacked on the same day. ",
            "Another dispute arose in May 2012 when Pietersen, agitating for the freedom to play for longer in the Indian Premier League - where his popularity was unquestioned - briefly announced his retirement from all forms of limited-overs international cricket. Pietersen's frustration had a disruptive effect on England's summer Test series against South Africa. The ECB regarded the matter as an unacceptable display of player power. He was dropped for the final Test at The Oval and omitted from World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, England predictable struggling in his absence.",
            "Pietersen was born in Pietermaritzburg to an Afrikaner father, Jannie, and an English mother, Penny, and abandoned South Africa cricket as a teenager in protest against the racial quota system which he felt was unfairly restricting his opportunities at KwaZulu Natal. He joined Nottinghamshire in 2000, attracted by the chance to work with Clive Rice, the county's coach and a former South Africa allrounder, but left at the end of the 2003 season after Nottinghamshire were relegated, unhappy with the standard of the Trent Bridge pitches and expressed his feelings strongly enough for the captain, Jason Gallian, to fling his kit out of the dressing room window. He signed for Hampshire, where he remained until 2010, at which point he decamped to Surrey to be close to his Chelsea home, but by then his county appearances had long become sporadic.",
            "His England career began in a low-key one-day series in Zimbabwe in 2004 when Andrew Flintoff was \"rested\" after expressing moral misgivings about the political regime of Robert Mugabe. Pietersen averaged 104 in England's 4-0 victory. A subsequent tour of South Africa was more daunting, but he produced three audacious centuries in the series, his unbeaten 100 in 69 balls becoming England's quickest ODI hundred. He went on to reach 1000 one-day runs in just 21 innings - equalling Viv Richards' record. ",
            "Test cricket beckoned with the 2005 Ashes the following summer: Pietersen's selection ahead of Graham Thorpe representing the toughest selectorial decision of early summer. He sealed the return of the urn after 17 years with a stroke-filled 158 at The Oval on the final day of the series. England needed to avoid defeat to regain the Ashes and Pietersen was dropped three times on the way to 60, but tension gave way to scenes of jubilation as his adrenalin-charged climax included seven sixes, breaking Ian Botham's record for England in an Ashes Test. He was named man of the match, finished an uneven series as top scorer, with 473 runs at 52.55 and, like the rest of the side, was awarded an MBE amid an atmosphere of national jubilation. He was also named as one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year.",
            "The subsequent years were a whirl of exciting innings, occasional rash dismissals and celebrity engagements. Sri Lanka's visit to England in 2006 was a high point. He matched his highest Test score of 158 in the first Test and in the following Test at Edgbaston, to general incredulity he unveiled the Switch Hit as he reversed his stance to slog-sweep Muttiah Muralitharan for six. There was no more appropriate way for a player of Pietersen's razzamatazz to become the first batsman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to score a century in three successive Test innings in England. The MCC ruled in 2008 that the shot was legal. He was up for the challenge, too, in Australia in 2006-7, averaging more than 50, and in the World Cup which followed, but England were a ramshackle lot as Flintoff, the captain, and coach Duncan Fletcher rarely had a meeting of minds. ",
            "Soon it was time for his ill-fated tilt at the England captaincy. His tenure officially began when Michael Vaughan, the Test captain, retired and Paul Collingwood stood down as ODI captain at the same time. Pietersen started with a century and victory against South Africa at The Oval but that was perhaps as close as he ever got to acceptance from the establishment. England's ODI series against India ended prematurely because of terrorist attacks on Mumbai, but England returned to fulfil the Test tour amid unprecedented security as Pietersen expressed the need not to be cowed by terrorism. But behind the scenes Pietersen's relationship was deteriorating with Moores, a coach with no international experience and an unrelenting work ethic. Pietersen recommended, rather too publicly, that Moores be removed and got his way, only to be summarily sacked as well. His relationship with the ECB never entirely recovered. Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower, who took over as captain and coach, had much healing to undertake.",
            "Alongside brushes with management - a feature in all the teams he has played for - injuries have interrupted him at key moments. His 2009 Ashes campaign was cut short by leg trouble that needed surgery and he left the 2011 World Cup with a hernia. His form became mercurial rather than reliable and he seemed to develop a curious fallibility against a succession of left-arm spinners, some more renowned than others. But he ended a 20-month wait for an international century by making a career-best 227 as England won the Ashes in Australia for the first time in 24 years, then scored 533 runs at 106.60 in England's 4-0 home whitewashing of India that secured them the No.1 ranking in Tests. His reputation as one of England's greats could no longer be denied.",
            "He was also the Man of the Tournament in England's World Twenty20 win in 2010 but his one-day batting tailed off, with no centuries over a three-year period between 2009 and 2011. He scored two in successive innings against Pakistan in 2012 - including his highest ODI score of 130 - and, briefly, it appeared they would be his last innings in coloured kit for England when he announced his retirement from limited-overs internationals, briefly seduced by the attractions of IPL. ",
            "England's Test against South Africa at Headingley in 2012 captured his career in microcosm. His power struggle with the ECB had left him moody and unpredictable before the Test, but when the match began he struck a quite brilliant 149 and, in the process, became the fastest man in terms of time, to reach 7,000 Test runs. That was quickly followed by more off-field drama, as reports of derogatory text messages about his captain, Strauss, to South Africa players, filled the media. Pietersen was dropped for the next Test at Lord's and, even though he did an about turn and reconfirmed his desire to play for England in all formats, forgiveness did not come quickly enough for him to play in World Twenty20. When he was officially invited back into the ranks, in Colombo, he had to sit next to the ECB chairman, Giles Clarke, as details of his \"reintegration process\" were sternly issued.  His response was to bat as well as ever. His 186 in Mumbai was a jewel in England's crown as they won a Test series in India for the first time in 28 years."

            "It has been a career of reinvention for Matthew Wade, who went from Test wicketkeeper to specialist middle-order batter to T20I World Cup-winning wicketkeeper-finisher, via a prolific run in domestic cricket when it appeared his international days were over.",
            "Wade was a talented junior footballer, but at 170cm decided he was too short to make a career out of it and pursued cricket instead. It wasn't plain sailing: that he played any international cricket at all is a credit to his mental toughness - at 16, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and required two cycles of chemotherapy to defeat the illness.",
            "He moved from Hobart to Melbourne when he realised he would be stuck behind Tim Paine in the Tasmania wicketkeeping queue. Victoria gave him a chance and he grabbed it, making 83 and taking six catches on his first-class debut. Wade would later become a Sheffield Shield-winning captain for Victoria, leading them to two titles in their hat-trick of wins between 2015 and 2017.",
            "Though he showed promise early in his Test career, including two hundreds in his first ten Tests, there was too much competition for the wicketkeeping spot. When his childhood friend Paine was handed the job for the 2017-18 Ashes, it looked like Wade had missed the bus, but he moved back to Tasmania, dominated state cricket for two seasons, and earned a spot for the 2019 series against England - in which he scored two centuries. That was followed by a return to the Australia white-ball set-ups. ",
            "A brief, successful, stint as T20I opener in David Warner's absence, on the back of dominant BBL seasons as an opener with Hobart Hurricanes, made Wade Australia's first-choice T20I wicketkeeper in 2020-21, and he also captained the T20I team in two series while Aaron Finch was out. He was vice-captain for the 2021 T20 World Cup, and recast as a finisher. And it was in that role that he delivered arguably the most important innings of the T20 World Cup, in the semi-final against Pakistan to get Australia home, after which they went on to take the title.\n"

        "bio": [
            "The classiest, calmest man on a cricket field, Hashim Amla's name is etched in South African cricket history. With his wristy leg-side flick and serene cover drive, Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket, while also effectively shifting gears to become the fastest batsman to 2,000 (40 innings), 3,000 (57 innings), 4,000 (81 innings) and 5,000 (101 innings) runs in ODI cricket. ",
            "Amla's career began at Durban High School, the alma mater of Lance Klusener and Barry Richards, and a world away from his brother, Ahmed. Just four years apart, they grew up on either side of the Apartheid divide, which meant that Ahmed went to a school for the previously disadvantaged, while Amla was afforded better opportunity at a more prestigious institution. ",
            "After a successful school career, Amla toured New Zealand with the South African Under-19 team in 2000-01 and captained them at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup. After reeling off four centuries in his first eight innings of the 2004-05 season - in which he was also appointed, and stepped down as, Dolphins captain - he was picked to play for South Africa against India.  ",
            "He was not an instant success, with serious questions emerging about his technique and his back lift, in particular, as he mustered 36 runs in four innings against England later that season.",
            "When he was handed a second chance, he made it count with 149 against New Zealand at Cape Town, helping South Africa to a draw. He remained a consistent performer, even if not as prolific as South Africa would have liked, and made fifties against Pakistan in 2007. But he saved his best for the following year's tour of India, where he racked up 307 runs in three Tests. That included a majestic 159 in Chennai, his second score of 150 or more. He followed that with a pugnacious 81 in the second innings, in conditions that were trying, thanks to the weather, the pitch and the attack. In the summer of 2008, he got his name on the honours board at Lord's with a sublime century, and, in the process, silenced all whimpers about his pedigree for the longest version.",
            "Still, doubts remained over his ability in the shorter formats, but Amla corrected that in 2010. He scored over 1,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket.  It started with a magnum opus tour of India, where the hosts threw everything at him, but could not find a way past his monk-like patience and ability to soak pressure. In the two-Test series, he scored 490 runs and was dismissed just once. In ODIs, he combined quick scoring with stunning consistency, scoring five centuries and four fifties in 15 innings, all the while scoring at over a run a ball, which saw him rise to No.1 in the ODI rankings that year.",
            "He was promoted to South Africa's leadership core when he was named vice-captain of the ODI and T20 international teams in June 2011, and later that year, scored centuries in both Tests South Africa played against Australia at home. But Amla's crowning moment came the following year, when he got South Africa's quest to become the No.1-ranked Test team off to an epic start, spending 13 hours and 10 minutes at the Oval crease crafting a triple hundred, and not even needing a change of gloves. Amla also scored a century at Lord's as South Africa took the Test mace from the hosts. ",
            "A quickfire 196 against Australia in Perth ensured South Africa stayed on top, and in February 2013, Amla was the ICC's top-ranked Test batsman. He had also decided to keep away from captaincy promotions, and stepped down as the limited-overs vice-captain. ",
            "That was why it came as a surprise when, less than 18 months later, Amla accepted the Test captaincy. His tenure was off to a solid start as South Africa beat Sri Lanka 1-0 away from home in his first series in charge, and West Indies at home in his second, in which Amla scored a double hundred in the first match. But that proved a false dawn."

Burl made his Zimbabwe U-17 and U-19 debuts within a month of each other in 2010-11, and his first-class debut, for Mashonaland Eagles, in 2014; in his second match of the Logan Cup that season, he made 92 and 66.",

In mid-2019, Burl's batting in international white-ball cricket seemed to kick into a higher, more consistent, gear. He hit a 28-ball 54 in a T20I series-winning effort against Bangladesh in 2022. A month later, Burl, a part-time legspinner, starred in Zimbabwe's first win in any format in Australia, taking 5 for 10 in three overs in an ODI in Townsville."

            "Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014. But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann.",
            "While many critics dismissed him as a \"part-time\" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. And while he suffered more than his share of ups and downs, for the next five years he manfully carried the load in one of the most under-resourced areas of the English game. When he was dropped during the 2019 Ashes, subsequently losing his central contract, it turned out to be the beginning of the end for Moeen as a Test allrounder; nevertheless, on calling time in 2021, he finished just shy of 3000 Test runs and 200 wickets, making him England's third most-prolific spinner of all time.",
            "He was also a 50-over World Cup winner, as well as a regular at the IPL - his flair for fast scoring and utility as an allrounder encouraging the decision to focus solely on white-ball cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup in the UAE. Moeen admitted that he felt his batting had been \"wasted\" in Test cricket, where he featured everywhere from No. 1 to No. 9, but there will still moments to treasure, from an unbeaten hundred in his second Test to four centuries in the calendar year in 2016.",
            "He also managed a Test hat-trick, against South Africa at The Oval in 2017, during a series in which he took 25 wickets and scored 252 runs, and played a significant part in England winning the 2015 Ashes, as well as the 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka in 2018-19. A measure of his abilities as a Test bowler were his six dismissals of Virat Kohli - the last of which, in what turned out to be Moeen's final match, took him past Jim Laker's 193 Test dismissals.",
            "It was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. His outstanding 108 not out, spread over 6-and-a-half hours and 281 balls, against Sri Lanka at Headingley took England to within two balls of saving the series but, while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an Englishman in a Test - developed after consulting Saeed Ajmal at Worcestershire - he initially struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling.",
            "That changed in training for the Lord's Test against India. Encouraged by team-mate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test offspinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an onlooker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight. It was to prove a pivotal meeting. Moeen was tighter at Lord's, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth-highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent.",
            "Moeen had already made ODI and T20I debuts in the West Indies, before playing all four of England's games at the 2014 World T20. And while he struggled to recapture his batting form after that maiden century in Tests, he took his chance when promoted to the top of the order in the ODI side by hitting a 72-ball century in Colombo and ended the year a regular in all formats.",
            "Part of the team that failed abysmally at the 2015 World Cup, Moeen was also a key member of the revolution under Eoin Morgan, usually batting at No. 7 - from where he thrashed a 53-ball hundred against West Indies in 2017 - and providing spin back-up to his friend Adil Rashid. His captaincy skills also came to the fore, helping Worcestershire to secure a maiden T20 title and guiding Birmingham Phoenix into the final of the inaugural Hundred. In 2020, he became the first British Asian to captain England in a T20I.",
            "He had looked destined for such success for some time. Signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old, he made a century on first-class debut against Cambridge MCCU (he remains the second-youngest man to score a first-class half-century for the club) and Championship debut against Nottinghamshire but was dropped for the next game on both occasions. He also captained England Under-19s to the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup, blasted a 56-ball century in an U19 Test against Sri Lanka and, as a 14-year-old, smashed 195 not out in a Twenty20 match for his under-15 club side Moseley Ashfield. The next highest score was 11.",
            "But, frustrated by a lack of opportunity at Warwickshire during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign as coach of the club, he left for local rivals Worcestershire at the end of 2006 and was a key part of the team that won the Pro-40 title in 2007. It included a 46-ball century against Northants in 2007; there had, at the time, been only one faster List A century made in England in matches involving two first-class counties.",
            "There were setbacks. Trying to combat a tendency to nick off, he went through a period of batting like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and then a spell of leaving balls that hit his off stump instead. But he made 1270 runs in 2010 and 1375 runs in 2013 - the year he won the PCA's Most Valuable Player award - as he augmented his flair with increased discipline. All the while, his offspin continued to improve."

            "King made his first-class debut for Jamaica in 2014-15 but had a breakout season in 2018-19, when he racked up 630 runs in seven games, landing him a middle-order slot in the West Indies A side. King also debuted in the CPL in 2017 with St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, but flew under the radar until his switch to Guyana Amazon Warriors in 2019, where coach Johan Botha spotted his potential and bumped him up the order. He responded with 496 runs in 12 games, the most by anyone in the tournament that year, at a strike rate of 149, including an unbeaten 132 against Barbados Tridents, then the highest individual score in the CPL.",
            "A step-up to the national squad seemed the natural order of things, but though King produced acceptable, if not earth-shattering performances in limited-overs series against Afghanistan, India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, he was dropped from the side in late 2020. On his recall a year later, he scored fifties in T20Is against Pakistan and England, and an unbeaten 58 and 91 in an ODI series win against Netherlands.\n"

In the final match at Bready, he single-handedly outscored Ireland with his 82 off 54 balls, which included seven sixes.",

Hidden in the euphoria of the six sixes was the fact that Zazai matched Yuvraj and Chris Gayle for the fastest fifty in all T20 cricket off 12 balls. "

            "The rise from that controversy at Newlands in 2018 was near-miraculous: Smith returned to Test cricket with a 774-run Ashes series in 2019, and pictures of him in tears at Sydney airport after his return in disgrace from South Africa were replaced in the popular memory with those of triumphant celebrations of centuries. Part of his punishment for Cape Town was being banned from any leadership position for two years, but once he served that penance, in late 2021 he was named Pat Cummins' vice-captain and a few weeks later led the side against England when Cummins was ruled out of a Test by Covid.",
            "Smith began his Test career in 2010 as a legspinner who batted at No. 8; by the time he was named Australia's captain five years later, he was the No. 1 Test batter in the world and no more than an occasional bowler. His talent was apparent early, but as a young batter he had more moving parts than an orchestra - only, they didn't always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls but could play every shot in the book, and a few others that defied words besides. Quick-footed and adept at facing spin, he is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast bowlers.",
            "When he was appointed Australia's 45th Test captain, Smith was filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three Tests. That was during a markedly purple patch, even by his standards: he produced six hundreds in eight Tests then, against India, West Indies and England. Despite being only 25 at the time, the extra responsibility clearly didn't hamper his run-making, and Smith cemented his spot when Clarke retired at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England.",
            "As Smith's batting developed, his bowling became less frequently sighted, although he could still land the odd fizzing legbreak and winkle out a wicket or two. In the field his athleticism and instinct stand out, even in a high-quality fielding side like Australia. He has also been a key man in Australia's ODI side, was his country's leading run-scorer in their triumphant 2015 World Cup campaign, and became captain in all three formats before his career was turned upside down. \n"

In 2013 he was on the books at Nottinghamshire and scored 47 in his only senior game, against Bangladesh A. He was later a part of the MCC Young Cricketers Programme at Lord's for two years and had other trials around the county scene with Durham, Essex and Kent, but didn't make it in English first-class cricket.",
            "Despite that lack of success, Cross is considered arguably the finest pure wicketkeeper of his era in Associate cricket. His leg-side stumping of England's James Taylor standing up to the medium pace of Josh Davey at the 2015 World Cup was the first of many highlight-reel-worthy dismissals.",
            "If there's a blemish on Cross' CV, his batting record at times appears underwhelming for a player of his calibre, especially one who has spent a significant chunk of time opening the batting. His high-water mark came in 2018, when he made twin hundreds against UAE and a rollicking 48 off 39 balls - including ten fours -  that helped kickstart Scotland's historic ODI victory over No. 1-ranked England at the Grange. But that innings in some ways sums up much of Cross' Scotland career with the bat, which has often been good but rarely great.  ",
            "He was named vice-captain in 2022, and when Richie Berrington suffered a hand injury against New Zealand during the home summer Cross made his Scotland captaincy debut in a stand-in capacity on his home ground in Aberdeen in August during an ODI tri-series against the UAE and USA.\n"

Scoring a century in just his fourth ODI - against Bermuda - he followed it with another in the next game against Kenya and averaged 110 in the World Cricket League. He then contributed a crucial 85 in the 2007 World Cup win over Bangladesh and scored further centuries against Scotland, Bangladesh and England as Ireland continued to press for Full Membership of the ICC.

A technically sound batter with strokes all around the wicket, he has also impressed with his temperament to build and pace innings.",
            "Chandimal made his international debut at 21 and impressed almost immediately, scoring 111 in his second ODI, against India in a triangular series in Zimbabwe. Four innings later he made another century, against England at Lord's, but it was in 2012 that his stocks rose significantly, when he averaged 50 on tours to South Africa and Australia, making six fifties In 16 ODI innings. Earlier that season, on Test debut, he had made fifties in each innings in Durban, in Sri Lanka's first Test win ever in South Africa. ",
            "Early in 2013, Chandimal became Sri Lanka's youngest ever captain, at 23, when he was handed the reins of the T20 side and was also named Angelo Mathews' deputy in Tests and ODIs. He made back-to-back Test hundreds, against Bangladesh at home, and captained the limited-overs sides off and on over the next four years.",
            "His rise to the national team came after consistent performances with bat and gloves in age-level cricket. That included an attacking century against India Under-19s in August 2007 and an unbeaten 112 in the tri-nation series against England U-19s the following year, which earned him a call-up to the squad for the U-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2008.",
            "In the Galle Test against India in 2015, Chandimal almost single-handedly dragged Sri Lanka to a win, wrested the advantage back with 162 from No. 6 at nearly a run a ball in the second innings after Sri Lanka were tottering at 95 for 5, having conceded a lead of nearly 200.",
            "In the 2016 home series against Australia, Chandimal was key to Sri Lanka sealing the whitewash, effecting another rescue after a disastrous start left them at 26 for 5 in the last Test, in Colombo: he bedded in for a six-hour 132 in the first innings, and put on a 90-run partnership with Kaushal Silva in the second.",
            "In 2017, after Mathews stepped down from the captaincy in all formats, Chandimal was named as his replacement, but only held the post for little over a year. By this point he was mostly as a Test specialist and not regularly in the reckoning for selection in the white-ball squads. That year, he led Sri Lanka to one of their finest Test series wins, 2-0 against Pakistan in the UAE, to which he contributed 155 not out in the first match and a fifty in the second. In the series in India that followed, a big hundred from him in the third Test helped wrest a draw after the home side piled up 536 in the first innings. ",
            "Chandimal hit a bit of a rough patch after that, with only three fifties and a hundred over the next two years, leading into the Covid pandemic, and he didn't quite thrive in 2021 either. He broke his funk the following year with an unbeaten 206 against Australia that levelled the two-Test home series against them, and provided something of an encore, scoring 76 and 94 not out in the next Test, against Pakistan in the series that followed. Sri Lanka lost that match but won the next, where Chandimal set up their first innings nicely, top-scoring with 80."

He took the rejection in his stride and threw himself into white-ball cricket, playing for Singapore - including at the T20 World Cup qualifier in 2019 - and winning sporadic opportuntiy for the Scorchers in the BBL.",

After a breakout BBL season, he was picked by Lahore Qalandars for the second half of the PSL: he kept performing, and contracts kept coming: for Surrey, Southern Brave, St Lucia Kings, RCB and Multan, then for Mumbai. In IPL 2022, he faced 86 balls and hit 16 of them for six, finishing the season with the best-ever strike rate for a batter in a single campaign (min. 50 balls) despite being dropped early on in the competition.",
            "David's opportunities have largely come as a finisher but he has occasionally batted at No. 3 and hopes to develop into a versatile T20 batter. He is a genuine power-hitter, particularly strong down the ground in the mould of Kieron Pollard, his team-mate at Mumbai Indians in 2022. After a stress fracture in his foot while on his rookie deal at WA, he switched from seam to spin and now bowls handy offbreaks, and is also a reliable fielder in the deep at long-on or midwicket."

Bowling is ostensibly Perera's major skill but, often deployed in the lower-middle order, he is also capable of delivering furious finishes to an innings.

Perera played a key role in helping his school break the hoodoo in the Battle of the Saints (against St Peters College) that lasted more than 35 years.

His older brother Chris also captained the men's side, while his aunt Cheryl and other brother Colin played for representative PNG sides, leaving little doubt about CJ's future career path.",

Serving as a longtime vice-captain to Assad Vala, Amini's ability to produce handy spells of legspin in addition to timely contributions with the bat have made him a leader by deed as much as by word.",
            "But Amini is perhaps best known for his dynamic fielding. Whether it is pulling off outrageous one-handed catches or his electric speed to the ball before firing direct hits into the stumps, he has built a reputation as a fielder not worth taking unnecessary risks on.",
            "By the age of 30, Amini was among the top five wicket-takers and run-getters for PNG in ODIs and T20Is. The only missing feather in his cap is being appointed full-time PNG captain, which seems inevitable before his career is through.\n"

When the season resumed later in 2021, DC decided to continue with Pant as their captain.",

Early the following year he produced 159 off 189 balls in a giant India total in Sydney, which sealed their first series in Australia. An encore followed early in 2021, when he made a brisk 97 at the SCG, helping wrest a draw off Starc, Cummins, Lyon and Hazlewood after India were staring down the barrel. ",
            "Pant's finest batting hour came in the classic that followed in Brisbane: an unbeaten 89 to steer a veritable India third XI home in a tall chase, and to their second series win down under in two visits. In Cape Town at the start of 2022, he made an almost ludicrous 100 off 139 in an India total where the next highest score was 29. And later that year, he set India up with a rapid 146 in the first innings of the postponed last Test of their tour of England from 2021 - only for England to outgun them in a berserker fourth-innings chase.",
            "It is a mark of Pant's no-fear, no-brakes batting that in his first four years in the game, he had as many scores between 90 and 100 in Tests as he did hundreds. It is the only way he has known: a year after making his Ranji Trophy debut at 18 in 2015, Pant scored a triple-hundred against Maharashtra, followed by two blistering centuries in a game against Jharkhand a month on - one of them ending in 135 off 67 balls.",

            "A level-headed cricketer of immense talent, Cameron White long seemed destined to play a significant role for Australia. At the start of his career it was hard to know whether he would develop into a nagging legspinner, aggressive middle-order batsman, intuitive skipper, or a bit of all three. After being tried as a Test leggie in India in 2008, it became apparent that batting was his focus and he developed into a destructive stroke-maker in the shorter formats. His maturity was recognised when he was named as Australia's Twenty20 captain in 2011. The appointment lasted only a year due to his batting form but it was a natural fit, for he had nearly a decade of captaincy experience having led Victoria in 2003-04 at the age of 20. The youngest skipper in their history, he won rave reviews for his cool head and warm handling of more hardened contemporaries. For all that, he remained a largely unassuming country lad. Picked to tour Zimbabwe when Stuart MacGill withdrew for moral reasons, White cancelled a fishing trip to attend the press conference then boyishly shrugged aside questions about the circumstances of his selection. He was chosen as much for his no-frills batting as his bowling; David Hookes, the late Victorian coach, felt White's best chance of representing Australia was to earn a top-six spot.",
            "White first emerged as a peculiarly unAustralian-style legspinner, tall and robust, relying on changes of pace and a handy wrong'un rather than prodigious turn or flight. He would even start a spell with an offspinner or quicker ball. As far back as December 2002 his hero Shane Warne had predicted: \"I think he's a [future] Australian player provided he sticks to the way he plays and doesn't try to be someone different.\" White made his ODI debut during the Super Series a year after missing a first Test cap when Nathan Hauritz was preferred in India. The retirement of Brad Hogg in early 2008 opened up an ODI spin position and White was given the first chance to secure the role. He even won a call-up to the Test squad in India when Victoria's first-choice leggie Bryce McGain went down with a shoulder injury. Despite his discomfort at being the No. 1 spinner, he held firm on debut while facing the best players of slow bowling in the business. As the series wore on it became clear he was not the answer to Australia's troubles and after four matches he was shifted aside with five wickets and 146 runs. It was time to try again as a batsman."

            "Meaty, muscular and mighty, Graeme Smith was a colossus as South Africa's captain, and not much less so in his contribution as a batter, in the first two decades of the 21st century. ",
            "Smith's leadership and batting were all about being direct and upfront. The subtleties of captaincy grew into his game, but he was generally most comfortable surging once more unto the breach himself with a cursory backward glance to see if his men were following. His batting was similarly forthright: anything bowled near his pads was sent screaming through midwicket. Anything drivable on the off side was driven, brutally, often inelegantly, but always effectively. Square of jaw and shoulder, they didn't call him \"Biff\" for nothing. ",
            "Smith was handed the reins at 22 - which made him his country's youngest captain - and tasked with rebuilding South Africans' faith in the integrity of game itself, which had been shattered by Hansie Cronje's greed and was not restored completely under Shaun Pollock's sincere but undemonstrative leadership. If Pollock was too maturely minded a captain for South African sensibilities, Smith was spot-on: an overgrown schoolyard bully of the nicest possible type, who would just as soon take a (verbal) swing at an opponent as buy him a beer. ",
            "The double-centuries he scored in his 11th and 12th Tests (just his third and fourth as captain), in England in 2003 made for an ironclad argument to retain his overtly direct approach to getting the job done.",
            "Those were his early days in charge, but arguably his greatest triumph came much later, when he led South Africa to their first Test series victory in Australia, in 2008-09, memorably batting with a broken hand in Sydney. Under his leadership, South Africa became truly dominant tourists, winning eight away series and losing none between 2007 and 2013. They also went undefeated in 11 series overall between April 2006 and December 2008. He was also the first captain to lead in more than 100 Tests. ",
            "Through all his Test triumphs, though, Smith couldn't get his hands on a chunk of ICC silverware. He quit international cricket after a lean series with the bat at home against Australia in March 2014. He went on to serve as Cricket South Africa's director of cricket after retirement, and in 2022 was appointed commissioner of the SA20, South Africa's attempt at a top-tier T20 league.\n"

He made his ODI debut towards the end of the year and although not the finished article nor a proven player at this level, he was chosen in their 2015 World Cup squad."

            "- He was formidable in the 2022 season, taking 17 wickets to go with his 300-plus runs from 14 games. However, KKR had a disappointing season, finishing seventh.",

            "A world-class seam-bowling allrounder from Jamaica, Andre Russell made his first-class debut at 19 and Test debut at 22, but it is as a T20 legend, sought after by every franchise league in the world, that he will be remembered.",
            "By the time Russell was little more than five years into international cricket, he was a two-time T20 world champion. A batter who hits the ball hard enough to make it scream for mercy, he functions primarily as a finisher. He generates fair pace and bounce with the ball in hand and when it is anywhere near him in the field, it doesn't matter at what speed it's travelling; Russell will probably get to it. He is less a cricketer, in the traditional sense, than an athlete.",
            "He first came to notice with his exploits in a 50-over game against Ireland in June 2010, smashing 61 off 34 balls and taking 6 for 42. It was a performance that helped him win a place in West Indies' 2011 World Cup squad. Things didn't go to plan in that tournament, but Russell's capabilities were on show against newly crowned champions India in June when he came out at No. 9, with the score at 96 for 7, and smashed 92 off 64 balls.",
            "His impact in international cricket was somewhat sporadic until 2015, when, against South Africa in Port Elizabeth, he provided a consolation victory for West Indies on a difficult tour by hitting 64 off 40 balls to chase down 263 with one wicket to spare. ",
            "Russell's skills were evident in domestic T20 cricket all along. He had a ground-breaking CPL in 2013 when his team Jamaica Tallawahs became champions. Just as he was reaching stratospheric heights, he served time on the sidelines, when the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission charged him for not making himself available for drug tests on three occasions in 2015, an offence tantamount to one failed test. Russell was found guilty of a whereabouts-clause violation and banned for a year by an independent doping panel in Jamaica for most of 2017.",
            "His star shone brightest at the IPL in 2015, when he was named Player of the Series, and in the Big Bash League later that year, when he struck at 186.86 and picked up 16 wickets - joint-second best - from ten matches. He won the CPL with Tallawahs in 2013, the IPL with Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014, the Bangladesh Premier League with Comilla Victorians, the BBL with Sydney Thunder, and the Pakistan Super League title with Islamabad United in 2016.\n"

Fletcher had already made his limited-overs debut for West Indies by then, but his prime opportunities came in T20 leagues around the world - the CPL, the BPL, the PSL and the BBL, but surprisingly not the IPL. One of his most memorable innings was a 49-ball 89 not out for Melbourne Stars in the 2020-21 BBL - an innings that came after a call from Brian Lara while Fletcher was in the middle of a major slump in form. In reply, to Fletcher's innings, Adelaide Strikers could only manage 68. ",

Stoinis was Victoria's leading run-scorer in the 2014-15 Sheffield Shield season and was called up to Australia's squad for limited-overs matches against England in 2015, where he debuted, playing an ODI and a T20I.

In his second ODI, Stoinis took three wickets and scored 146 not out from No. 7 to help Australia almost pull off an unlikely victory against New Zealand at Eden Park. That innings gave him an unbroken run in the white-ball sides for about four years, during which time he cemented his position as one of the team's top finishers. ",

In the BBL, on the other hand, he has been an opener for Melbourne Stars.",

            "Brendan Taylor, a wicketkeeper-batter and statistically one of the finest players that Zimbabwe has ever produced, possibly grabbed the headlines more after his retirement than he had ever done with his many exploits during his playing days. In January 2022, four months after having retired, he shocked the cricketing world with a disturbing Twitter post on how corruptors tried to trap him in late 2019 with a combination of cocaine and blackmail. While he emphasised he never fixed, he said he had delayed reporting the approach to the ICC for fear of his family's well-being and expected to be banned for this by the governing body. He was duly banned for this delay by the ICC, from all cricket, for three and a half years from January 28, 2022.",
            "In the same Twitter post, Taylor pointed out how the uncertainty around being a cricketer in Zimbabwe pushed him to meet the corruptors, whom he thought were Indian businessmen interested in sponsorship deals and running a T20 league in the country. He said he had not been paid for six month prior to that fateful meeting where he was offered cocaine. The corruptors filmed him taking it and later threatened to release the footage to the world unless Taylor spot-fixed for them. Fearing for his life, he took the USD 15,000 they offered him and returned home to Zimbabwe. He reported the approach to the ICC four months later. ",
            "At the same time, Taylor also outlined his struggles with substance abuse, and said he would be going into rehab. In an interview that followed, he also admitted to having failed a drugs test after his final international game, an ODI against Ireland on September 13, 2021. ",
            "Before all this, Taylor had briefly abandoned Zimbabwe's international set-up after the 2015 World Cup. Disillusioned with international cricket and having fallen out with then-coach Stephen Mangongo, he signed a three-year Kolpak deal with Nottinghamshire which made him ineligible to play for Zimbabwe while that contract was in effect. But, midway through his final season at Notts he gained permission for an early release, citing homesickness: his wife Kelly had remained in Zimbabwe with their four young sons. And so at 31, he returned to Test cricket, against West Indies in Bulawayo, nearly three years after his previous innings.",
            "In the decade that followed his debut in April 2004, Taylor was involved in almost every ODI - the format Zimbabwe played most often - his country took part in. He was appointed captain after the 2011 World Cup, as Zimbabwe worked towards a return from a self-imposed exile from Test cricket. He led them to a successful Test comeback later that year, in which he also scored his maiden century, and to a win over Pakistan a month later. ",
            "Under Taylor, Zimbabwe seemed a renewed force, despite a sparse fixture list and struggles away from home. As one of the senior-most players in the squad, Taylor played an important part in unifying the players in their off-field battles over unpaid salaries and the formation of a players' association.",
            "The additional responsibility of captaincy, which he had always fancied, worked wonders for his batting, as he scored four centuries in his first seven Tests in charge, after scoring none in his ten previous Tests. He also scored hundreds in each innings against Bangladesh in Harare in 2013, thus becoming the first from Zimbabwe, and the 12th in all, to achieve this feat. ",
            "Taylor shot to prominence at Cape Town on September 12, 2007, his ice-cool 60 not out carrying Zimbabwe to an incredible five-wicket win over Australia in the ICC World Twenty20. Taylor marshalled a tense run-chase with the sort of sang froid that few had ever credited him with."

He could be more aggressive than Virender Sehwag, played the kind of back-to-the-wall innings that would do Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman proud, and accumulated without taking many risks, much like Sachin Tendulkar did in the last quarter of his career. Either side of that period, though, Gambhir's technical flaws dominated his other attributes. Still, with over 10,000 runs in international cricket, and two significant innings in World Cup finals - not to mention leading Kolkata Knight Riders to two IPL titles - Gambhir was a significant contributor to Indian cricket.",
            "For about the first eight years of his career, he was the domestic cheque that would not be honoured at international level. While bowlers on the Ranji circuit swore by his abilities, he had only two international centuries to show after 32 matches when he was left out of the 2007 World Cup party.",
            "He came back with massive runs in domestic cricket, a few important technical adjustments, and with the reputation of being the best player of spin in India outside of the international side. A century in his second ODI back and a title-winning 75 in the inaugural T20 World Cup paved the way for his Test return. Test fifties against Muthiah Muralidaran and Ajantha Mendis in 2008 told him he belonged. ",
            "Between October 2008 and February 2010, he scored eight centuries - to set up wins, to bat teams out, and to hold on for draws, including a near 11-hour marathon in Napier. In this period, he also managed half-centuries or more in 11 successive Tests, equalling Viv Richards. The Arjuna award, India's second-highest sporting honour, came his way, the ICC named him the Test player of 2009, and more tellingly perhaps, Sehwag called him the best Indian Test opener since Sunil Gavaskar. ",
            "Gambhir scored a match-winning 97 in the 2011 World Cup final. After that tournament, though, began a more serious, almost terminal decline. In England and Australia, where India lost eight Tests in a row, he was a walking wicket, poking at deliveries outside off. From being a captaincy candidate at one time, he went to struggling to keep his place in the side.  ",
            "With the arrivals of M Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan, Gambhir was sidelined until the England tour in 2014, when he was called up as back-up opener. But his return after more than a year out of international cricket ended on a sour note when he was dropped after two Tests. He was on firmer ground in the IPL - having been a mainstay at Delhi Daredevils and then going to Knight Riders for a record US$2.4 million in the 2011 auction. He top-scored for that team in four seasons, including during their first title win in 2012.",
            "Gambhir retired from all cricket in 2018. He received the Padma Shri, India's second-highest civilian honour, and became a member of Parliament a year later, but continued his association with the game, as a commentator. \n"

            "Allrounder, and Twitter star, Jimmy Neesham went from the brink of retirement from cricket to almost delivering New Zealand the 2019 World Cup. In the tournament he was outstanding with bat and ball then in the final against England claimed three wickets and produced the final-ball run out to tie the scores after 50 overs. He was entrusted with the bat in the Super Over and scored 13 off 5 balls including a huge six off Jofra Archer. He was at the non-striker's end for the last ball when Martin Guptill was run out coming back for a second run that would have won New Zealand the World Cup. ",
            "He made his international debut in a Twenty20 international on New Zealand's tour to South Africa in 2012-13, following some impressive performances in the shorter formats in the domestic season. Neesham began his first-class career with Auckland, but a move Otago worked well for him, as he made some important contributions in the 50-over format in the 2011-12 season, making three 40-plus scores in seven innings, all of them coming at more than a run a ball. He was among the wickets too, taking a career-best 5 for 44 against Wellington and 4 for 23 against Canterbury. The rewards came soon, as he was included in the limited-overs squads for the tour to South Africa and made his T20I and ODI debuts. ",
            "In February 2014, Neesham made a century on Test debut against India and was at the other end when skipper Brendon McCullum became the first Black Cap to score a Test triple century. He became just the eighth player in Test history to score hundreds in his first two Tests when he made a century against West Indies in Jamaica.",
            "He narrowly missed the cut for the home World Cup in 2015, an experience he described as \"gut-wrenching\", when Grant Elliott was preferred at the last minute. Neesham found himself in the stands at Eden Park as Elliott struck that iconic six against South Africa to secure a spot in the final."

            "Elton Chigumbura made his first-class debut for Mashonaland in the Logan Cup, aged only 15, in 2002 and has since established himself as Zimbabwe's premier allrounder and, for a time, captain of the national side. Chigumbura is a product of the ZC development programme and took to the game at Chipembere Primary School in the Highfield township of Harare. A protégé of coach Stephen Mangongo, he won a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School and represented Zimbabwe in two Under-19 World Cups.  ",
            "He made a name for himself at this level when he took four wickets in Zimbabwe's unexpected victory over Australia at the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2004. Chigumbura was fast-tracked into the Zimbabwe national side in the absence of the 'rebel' players later that year and despite looking out of his depth on Test debut against Sri Lanka, he appeared a much-improved player by the time of the Champions Trophy five months later where he put in a good allround performance against Sri Lanka, scoring 57 and picking up 3 for 37. ",
            "Chigumbura was capable of surprising pace before being forced to sit out much of 2005 after sustaining a stress fracture of the back during the South Africa tour in March of that year. He played as a specialist batsman on the West Indies tour in May 2006 due to his injury, and in the home series against Bangladesh which followed and as his bowling recovered consistent, if unspectacular, performances lead to his inclusion in the squad for the Africa XI v Asia XI games in 2007. Chigumbura acquitted himself admirably in the first match at Bangalore, dominating his 67-run partnership with Shaun Pollock with a combative 40. He also played a vital role in Zimbabwe's victory over Australia at the World Twenty20 in South Africa, removing both openers and rotating the strike well as Zimbabwe squeaked home in the final over. ",
            "After a year of middling performances in 2008, Chigumbura came into his own in the home series against Kenya in 2009. He tormented the Kenyan bowlers, smashing consecutive scores of 79, 68, 43 and 36 at a strike rate well above a-run-a-ball, and picking up seven wickets for good measure.  He followed that up with a starring allround performance in the first match of the ODI series in Bangladesh, taking three cheap wickets and guiding Zimbabwe home with an unbeaten 60, but could not replicate his form in the remaining games of the series. In March 2010 Chigumbura signed up as Northamptonshire's overseas player for the County Championship and 40-over league.",
            "Chigumbura took over as captain of the national side after Prosper Utseya's resignation, having already cut his teeth on the role as Mashonaland Eagles' skipper, but after some initial success - including leading Zimbabwe to the finals of a home tri-series including India and Sri Lanka - Chigumbura's own form fell away alarmingly and in June 2011 he was replaced as captain by Brendan Taylor. He was handed back the limited-overs captaincy in July 2014 as part of ZC's plan to split the leadership between him and Taylor. ",
            "Probably the hardest-hitting batsman in the current side when on form, he particularly enjoys the lofted drive and is a very good, athletic outfielder. "

            "That Joe Root would one day captain England was taken as read when he hit the grand old age of 23. The accolade everybody anticipated became his three years later, when Alastair Cook stood down after the 2016-17 tour of India. It was understandable that there were a few fears for Root's future workload. He was rare among England batsmen in achieving maturity so quickly, and had looked consumed by the delights of batting from the moment he first took guard. Now he had new responsibilities. ",
            "Slight of build, perky of shot and with a scampish grin that got under a bowler's skin, by the time Root was appointed Test captain he had rattled up 53 Tests within five years with an average top side of 50, comfortably the highest among contemporary England players. Early expectations that he would establish himself as an opener did not materialise as an expansive game increasingly seemed better suited to No. 3 or No. 4. He was equally influential in limited-overs cricket where England's commitment to fearless cricket after their 2015 World Cup was much to his tastes, his crispness of stroke and shrewd judgment enabling him to bat purposefully around batsmen of greater weight of shot.",
            "Root had never been a strikingly heavy scorer as he worked through the ranks, nor was he particularly athletic, but his systematic approach was that of a young batsman who would not sell his wicket easily and gave England hope that he would be able to attune his game to the highest level. A slender batsman reliant on precision, his patience and stubbornness at the crease had Geoffrey Boycott gushing that he reminded him of himself, although Root soon developed a much broader range. Others saw some of his mentor Michael Vaughan in Root's front-foot drive - the pair also both attended Sheffield Collegiate.",
            "Root's Test debut for England in Nagpur in 2012 exemplified the qualities which had attracted coaches from an early age. Picked to tour India on the strength of two encouraging seasons with Yorkshire - and having been named Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year - he impressed enough to be selected for the final Test of the series. He began with England's sixth-longest debut innings in terms of balls faced, scoring 73 from 229 balls as he displayed the patience and discrimination demanded both by the situation of the game and a desperately slow surface. ",
            "His rise continued with a maiden Test hundred in his home ground, Headingley, against New Zealand in 2013 followed by a maiden Ashes century at Lord's having been promoted to open. Root looked set to occupy that role for many years to come, but his fortunes dipped as the series went on and then crashed along with the team as England were whitewashed in Australia in 2013-14. He began the tour at No. 6, moved up to No. 3 after the enforced departure of Jonathan Trott, then saw his Ashes ended early when he was dropped for the fifth Test in Sydney.",
            "Proof of Root's ability came in the way he responded. Back in England, he followed up a two-tone double hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's - a disciplined innings with a freewheeling finale - with two more big hundreds against India. All three had the not-out asterisk. That seemed to say a lot about him.",
            "He even had the fortune to skipper Yorkshire to the Championship title at Trent Bridge in 2014 when Andrew Gale was suspended, less than a fortnight after he became the first Yorkshire batsman to hit an ODI hundred at Headingley, with India the victims. He was also in charge for Yorkshire's thumping defeat at Middlesex, in which they chased down 472 in the fourth innings. To his amusement, his team-mates dubbed him \"Craptain\". ",
            "His full potential then poured forth in 2015 when he made 1385 Test runs in the year, and vied with Australia's Steven Smith at the top of the ICC Test rankings. Root played with alacrity on all surfaces and in all formats and his obvious delight in his art was a positive symbol in an England side committed in all formats to a more enterprising approach. Jaunty Ashes hundreds at Cardiff and Nottingham helped England to victories, his consistency at No. 4 repeatedly masked top-order frailties, and a mischievous sense of humour made his success all the more pleasurable.",
            "As England fell to defeat against Pakistan in the UAE in late 2015, a pattern began to build up which piqued Root even as he confirmed himself as one of the best batsmen around: his world became rather too full of entertaining 70s and 80s when he felt that a big hundred was there for the taking. Between his hundred in Johannesburg in early 2016 on a triumphant England tour and a century in Rajkot as England slumped 4-0 to India, he passed 50 six times but only converted one into a hundred. There again, it was quite a hundred: a career-best 254 against Pakistan at Old Trafford that banished talk of premature burnout in a non-stop England programme.",
            "Firmly established among the modern game's \"Big Four\" batsmen (Root, Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson), these were years of easy scoring. In 2015 and 2016 he set consecutive records for runs accumulated across all formats in a calendar year for England, with 2228 and 2570 respectively; in 2017, he came within five runs of surpassing Vaughan's calendar high-water mark of 1481 for England in Tests, which had stood since 2002. The following summer, with back-to-back efforts against India, Root surpassed Marcus Trescothick's English record of 12 ODI hundreds."

            "Sarfraz Ahmed is a wicketkeeper batsman who could have meandered into irrelevance, as has been the case for many capable cricketers on Pakistan's domestic circuit. Instead, he became the first Pakistan captain since the great Imran Khan to win a 50-over world title. ",
            "Sarfraz took over the ODI reins in February 2017, providing his side with rare single-minded direction and focus. In June that year, Pakistan went into the Champions Trophy as the lowest-ranked team and lost heavily against India to start off, but then went on a red-hot run to beat South Africa, Sri Lanka and hosts England, and finally India to claim the prize. ",
            "A right-hand middle-order batsman, Sarfraz wasn't always the sprightly presence that bossed the Sharjah Test of 2014 - when Pakistan chased 302 in 57.3 overs to level the series. In fact, between 2007 - when he made his debut - and 2014, Sarfraz had played just four Tests, four T20Is and 26 ODIs. He was miles off being a regular in any of Pakistan's sides, and not nearly good enough to warrant a place as a specialist batsman; he hadn't scored an international half-century in all this time. It was an era when the Akmals - no less than three of them - had taken out a lease on the area behind the stumps. ",
            "Sarfraz had appeared on Pakistan's radar initially by leading Pakistan's Under-19s to the World Cup title in 2006, scoring half-centuries in his third and fourth match. He broke into domestic cricket, where 523 runs in 10 matches along with 28 dismissals behind the stumps pushed him into the A team's tour of Australia in 2007. Then he was left in the wilderness. ",
            "It took seven long years for the spotlight to return to Sarfraz, when he made 74 in Pakistan's total of 359 in the second innings against Sri Lanka in Dubai. The innings was in a losing cause, but it did establish him as the team's first-choice wicketkeeper. He averaged 71.20 over the next 18 months, and during this period also elbowed his way into the ODI side midway through the 2015 World Cup campaign with a run-a-ball 49 against South Africa. ",
            "Since then, Sarfraz has been a man for all formats, steady with the gloves, aggressive with the bat and street-smart as a captain across formats. At 30, with the Champions Trophy tucked under his arm, he became arguably Pakistan's most respected cricketer since Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan. It would remain that way till October 2019, when a sustained loss of personal form saw him abruptly removed as captain in all three formats and dropped from the side entirely. "

Happily, Naib was able to force his way back into the national team in 2011 and settled into a floating role in Afghanistan's middle order, chipping in with both bat and ball. His maiden international fifty contributed to Afghanistan's first T20I series win over a Full Member, against Zimbabwe in October 2015. A few months later, he scored his first ODI fifty in a series win against the same opposition, to help Afghanistan break into the top ten in the ODI rankings. His biggest test came when he was promoted to captain the side for the 2019 World Cup; unfortunately Afghanistan failed to win a single game in the tournament."

            "Born in Oshakati, near the border with Angola, prior to independence from South Africa, Williams did his schooling in Pretoria, where he was team-mates with Roelof van der Merwe, before making a national debut for Namibia in the CSA provincial three-day competition in October 2007. A half-century in each innings was a portent of things to come.",
            "In a team that often had plenty of dashers come and go, Williams had a stabilising approach, most often at No. 4. But he was also versatile, adapting to almost any situation based on the talent around him. During the course of his career, he scored centuries at every position from opener down to No. 7, a feat that few in the Associate world can match. ",
            "Williams was almost as prolific with his brisk and canny medium pace, and versatile too, rotating from new ball to first or second change throughout his career. He is one of only four players to take 100 or more wickets for Namibia in both first-class and List A cricket.",
            "After initially retiring following Namibia's failure to advance out of the top two from World Cricket League Division Two on home soil in 2018, he had a change of heart and came back to play a pivotal role in the same tournament a year later. The team won and secured ODI status after which Williams helped them qualify for their first T20 World Cup. His 40 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi at the main event showed a glimpse of his class to the broader world. ",

            "A titan of not just Nepal but the entire Associate world, few people have had a greater impact on their country's fortunes on the cricket field than Paras Khadka. Literally and figuratively, he was a giant for his nation: the tallest with the broadest shoulders, more often than not the top-scorer and at times the leading wicket-taker too whether with his medium pace or his offspin. In terms of his domestic popularity, he was often described as Nepal's version of Sachin Tendulkar but his skillset was much more in line with Garry Sobers.",
            "Making his U-19 debut as a 15-year-old and his senior team debut as a 16-year-old in 2004, he was earmarked early on as a long-term player for the future and by 2009, he had been made senior team captain. His tenure marked the start of Nepal's steady rise up the global rankings, from Division Five of the World Cricket League to a maiden berth in the T20 World Cup in 2014 - where they scored victories over both Afghanistan and Hong Kong - before eventually attaining ODI status in 2018.",
            "Khadka played a total of 250 times for the senior team, and though his List A record of 1497 runs in 44 matches at an average of 35 may seem modest, Khadka's contributions often made the difference between Nepal reaching 250 or being bowled out for less than half of that. Because the talent surrounding him was threadbare, he regularly had to harness his naturally dynamic arsenal of strokes and instead focus on anchoring the innings. He was not just the spine of the Nepal batting order, but the brain, heart and all of the limbs too.",
            "It meant that for the majority of his career, Nepal's chances of victory came down to his individual performances: whether that was with the bat, opening the bowling with medium pace, or contributing with offspin later on. For this, he was always held in the highest esteem by any opposition captain. Perhaps no greater embodiment of what he could do as a grafting matchwinner came in Nepal's first ODI victory, at Amstelveen against the Netherlands, in August 2018: scoring 51, then taking 1 for 24 at the death as well as a runout off his own bowling ripping the stumps out to secure the final wicket in a one-run win.",
            "The only thing missing from Khadka's resume is a stint in major franchise cricket. His jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none skillset never caught the attention of bidders from the big money T20 leagues. As a result, he never got the acclaim he deserved outside of Nepal compared to his mythical status within the country. However, his influential role in paving the way for the next generation of players - like Sandeep Lamichhane - to reap those rewards cannot be overstated."

            "The most remarkable aspect about Misbah-ul-Haq is his unflappable temperament. It shows in his batting, which reached unprecedented levels of consistency in 2011, and in his captaincy, which helped lift Pakistan from the depths of the spot-fixing saga in England in 2010. Taking over as leader immediately after that episode at the age of 36, Misbah's calm approach was exactly what Pakistan cricket needed after the tumultuous period it had gone through.",
            "As a batsman, Misbah can either defend dourly with unflagging patience, or irritate bowlers with his improvisations. It helps that his defensive technique is sound: that solid foundation has helped him bat for long periods in Test cricket. That aspect of his game was in evidence right from his first Test innings in 2001, when he survived over two hours to score 28 in Auckland. He should have played much more international cricket thereafter, but was held back by his inconsistency. For four years between 2003 and 2007, he didn't play a single Test, and only turned up for a handful of ODIs.",
            "However, a run-filled domestic season, followed by club cricket in England and Inzamam's retirement from ODIs, prompted the board to award Misbah a central contract in July 2007. A month later, he was surprisingly picked, ahead of Mohammad Yousuf, for the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa. He repaid the selectors' faith by finishing the tournament as Pakistan's best player and nearly taking them to victory in the final. He continued the good run on the tour to India later that year, scoring two hundreds, each of which spanned more than 400 minutes. "

But though he went on to average over 40 in first-class cricket in 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14, he was unable to break into to the Test team. ",
            "Eventually, in August 2014, Rossouw was included in a South Africa ODI squad, but he had a nightmarish start in international cricket, racking up four ducks in his first six innings. The selectors, though, stuck with him and he was included in the T20 squad for the Australia tour in November 2014, where he scored 78 in his first match. ",
            "Two months on, Rossouw made his first international century, against West Indies in Johannesburg, in the match where AB de Villiers broke the record for fastest ODI hundred, and he averaged 52 in the six games he played in the ODI World Cup that followed. ",
            "In October 2016 he hit a sensational 122 to secure a 5-0 ODI series win over Australia, but he announced early the next year that he had signed for Hampshire as a Kolpak. He made an immediate impact in England, smashing a career-best 156 against Somerset in the Royal London Cup. ",
            "Rossouw became a man in demand on the franchise T20 circuit at the tail end of the 2010s and into the next decade, finishing the 2018-19 Bangladesh Premier League as the leading run-scorer, with 558 runs. He won the Pakistan Super League with Quetta in 2019 and two years later with Multan Sultans; in 2022 he made 275 runs as Sultans made it to the final again and lost.",
            "Later that year, the UK having exited the European Union, Rossouw, no longer able to qualify to play county cricket other than as an overseas player, returned to South Africa colours. He did so with a bang, making an unbeaten 96 and two back-to-back T20I hundreds as their No. 3 in his first few innings back, against England, India and Bangladesh - the last of those in the World Cup, where South Africa eventually endured a shock exit at the hands of Netherlands.\n"

            "He was selected for the ODI team at The Oval later that summer, and hit 50 on debut from No. 7 against India. He made another half-century, against New Zealand the following year, opening this time, but none after that in the four-odd years for which he was more or less a regular in the ODI side. ",
            "In England's T20 World Cup-winning team of 2010, he contributed 90 runs in significant circumstances, and though he bowled only one over in the tournament, he got rid of the in-form Cameron White in the final against Australia with it. Come the next edition of the tournament, he was one of England's most combative performers in a less impressive campaign in Sri Lanka, making an unbeaten 99 against Afghanistan, and 76 off 43 in a win against New Zealand. An injury ruled him out of the 2014 event in Bangladesh, and that was it for his England career. ",
            "Wright stayed in demand in T20 after that, and played 57 games across seven seasons for Melbourne Stars in the BBL, including making a sparkling 44-ball hundred in the very first season of the competition, 2011-12. And he spent the 2013-14 southern summer playing for Auckland in their Super Smash-winning campaign that year. ",
            "For Sussex, he was a force in T20. He made five hundreds in all for them, including an unbeaten 153 in a successful chase of 226 against Essex in 2014. The club rewarded his energy and optimism with the T20 captaincy in 2015, and followed up with leadership in all formats for the following season, but Wright was afflicted by injury in a generally below-par season. Captaincy did not suit him and he resigned midway through 2017, saying the responsibility had drained the enjoyment from his game.",
            "He ended his BBL career the following year, slightly prematurely, after a bout of concussion. On Blast Finals Day later in 2018, his final first-class season, his 92 against Glamorgan in the semi-final set up a 300th T20 appearance in the final - though Sussex lost that game. ",
            "Wright continued to churn out short-form runs in partnership with Phil Salt at the top of the Sussex order over the next two years. In 2022, having retired from playing at 37, he was appointed an England selector."

Also like Michael, Hussey has been forced to pile up mountains of runs in Australia before gaining the confidence of the national selectors. It took his first 1000-run season in 2007-08 before he was finally chosen for a tour, the ODI series in the West Indies in 2008, and earned his first Cricket Australia contract. Earlier in that summer he made his Twenty20 international debut against India at the MCG. Hussey was one of the big surprises in the Indian Premier League auction when Kolkata paid $625,000 to secure him - far more than the sums offered for his brother and Ricky Ponting. Over the next couple of years he was a regular in Australia's Twenty20 team and a fringe ODI player. In 2009-10, Hussey topped the Sheffield Shield run tally with 970 at 57.05, including 168 in the final as he helped Victoria raise the trophy with victory over Queensland. But within a month Hussey had lost his CA contract as the selectors looked to younger men.",
            "Despite his crash-and-bash style, Hussey is desperate not to be pigeon-holed as a Twenty20 player, although that appears to be where his international future lies. Still, he has been a standout first-class player in county cricket and for Victoria; only Simon Katich made more runs than him in the 2007-08 Sheffield Shield campaign. He only made two centuries and his best was 104 but his consistency was remarkable. Equally impressive was his 484 FR Cup runs at 44, including a 60-ball century - the second-fastest in Australia's domestic one-day history - that featured eight sixes. It was no surprise when Hussey was named Victoria's Player of the Year in all three formats. He had come off a prolific season at Nottinghamshire, where he made 1219 runs at 93.76, including 275 from 227 balls against Essex. The next summer he struggled in the Sheffield Shield before making an important century in the final win, and he held on to his national contract. That was soon followed by a brutal 88 from 44 balls in a Twenty20 international in Johannesburg, and his maiden ODI century came against Scotland in August 2009. "

Others might have given up, or at least relaxed, during all that time in the backblocks of the Sheffield Shield and County Championship, but Hussey maintained the intensity and was soon living in a statistical world occupied by few others. After two years in the Test side his average rose to 86.18; it had already taken 29 ODIs for his mean to drop below 100. In just 166 days he become the fastest player to 1000 Test runs, but he was reluctant to dwell on the records because he knew the sky-high ride wouldn't last.",
            "He was right and the recession hit hard in 2008-09. Despite being forced to battle for runs and his spot in the various teams, he continued to talk cheerfully and walk quickly. As a batsman he is old fashioned, preferring to work and caress the ball, especially through cover with a crisp drive. There are times when he breaks free - batting with the No.11 or in the final stages of a limited-overs innings - and in that mood he can pull ferociously, but mostly he travels at a safe speed. If they let him, he would bat for a week without becoming bored. ",
            "Having grown up as a specialist opener, he has spent most of his time in the middle order with Australia and hasn't complained. His team ethic is on display in the field, where he is a reliable catcher at gully and a regular encourager, and he is scrupulous at practice. The overall attitude earned him the Mr Cricket nickname, a moniker of fun and extreme respect.",
            "His doggedness at the crease created perceptions of his inability to stay in tune with the T20 format, but he busted the myth in a freak innings - an unbeaten 24-ball 60 in which he razed down 18 needed off the last over, bowled by Saeed Ajmal, to take Australia into the 2010 World T20 final. Having established himself in the shortest format, he then played a key role in Chennai Super Kings achieving the IPL and Champions League double in 2010, followed by another IPL crown in 2011.",

            "A talented, wristy strokeplayer, capable of opening the innings or batting in the middle order, Ravi Bopara was a regular member of the England set-up for several years without ever making himself indispensable. Admirers of his laid-back approach to life,  and there are many, forever lived in hope that his England career would finish in a blaze of glory, but England's inglorious World Cup campaign in 2015 - and his 120th ODI cap against Afghanistan in Sydney - was where his international story ended.",
            "Bopara believers from that point had to take their satisfaction in county cricket and, at Essex, he scored consistently enough across all formats to be in the top ten of run-scorers worldwide over the previous decade: a statistical challenge, along with his 100-plus appearances in all competitions, to those who regarded his career as unfulfilled.",
            "In 2002, aged 17, Bopara earned a professional contract with Essex and immediately established himself as a name for the future. He made his first-team debut the same year, playing three Championship matches before being picked for the Under-19 World Cup in 2003. Three years later, his county form was rewarded with a place in England's preliminary squad for the 2006 Champions Trophy and the Academy squad to be based in Perth during the winter's Ashes series.",
            "After impressing the selectors, he made his ODI debut against Australia at Sydney, and claimed the wicket of Mike Hussey to help England kick-start their trophy-winning campaign with a 92-run win. A fortnight later at the World Cup in the Caribbean, he showed impressive resolve and class in his maiden one-day fifty against Sri Lanka, albeit in a losing cause. He was one of only a handful of England players to emerge from that tournament with their reputation enhanced, but injury prevented him from building on his success at the inaugural World Twenty20.",
            "Three consecutive hundreds against West Indies in early 2009 rebalanced his ledger, only for a difficult Ashes experience to again cost him his place, and he remained on the fringes of the Test side. His form in limited-overs cricket, where his medium-pace bowling is also a useful option, has been more consistent, with some of his most mature displays coming under the ODI captaincy of his Essex team-mate Alastair Cook.",
            "Another encouraging display for England in their one-day series against Sri Lanka in October 2007 led to his call-up to the Test squad and he was picked to make his debut in the opening match at Kandy ahead of Owais Shah. It was, on reflection, a tour too soon for Bopara, who scratched 42 runs in three Tests, including three ducks in a row, and was axed the following January. But 14 months later, after flitting around the fringes of the ODI team, he seized his opportunity when Andrew Flintoff flew home from the Caribbean with a hip injury. Picked at No. 6 for the Barbados Test, he responded with a classy 104. Though omitted from the subsequent Test in Trinidad, to accommodate an extra bowler, he was recalled at No. 3 in the return series in England two months later and responded with hundreds in each of his next two innings, at Lord's and Chester-le-Street, to emulate the achievement of his mentor, Graham Gooch, in 1990.",
            "A decent showing in the subsequent World Twenty20 confirmed Bopara's place for the Ashes series that got underway in July, but not everyone was impressed with his attitude. After mustering 105 runs in seven innings, he was dropped for the series decider at The Oval, where Jonathan Trott exceeded that tally in a single knock. Two years in the Test wilderness followed, as Eoin Morgan moved ahead of him in the selectors' thoughts, before a return as cover for the injured Trott in the third and fourth Tests against India. Bopara looked on from the sidelines in the UAE as England's batting failed disastrously against Pakistan in 2012 but first a side injury, in Sri Lanka, and then a thigh muscle tear ahead of West Indies' visit, barred him from another crack at Test cricket.",
            "When it came, in the South Africa series after some impressive ODI innings against Australia, he quickly withdrew from the squad for personal reasons. He returned for World Twenty20 but still did not seem mentally attuned, as England meekly surrendered the title they won in 2010. His contribution in the 2013 Champions Trophy was more noteworthy, though he couldn't see England home in the final against India. Later that summer, he made his maiden ODI hundred in Dublin, but an Ashes trip to Australia (where he did not play a Test as England were whitewashed) suggested a player whose time might have gone. England's disastrous World Cup showing in 2015 "

That he is a rare talent has never been in doubt, but in international cricket, that raw ability has not usually translated into runs. Perhaps his fans will argue that he was asked to bat too low in limited-overs cricket to have a major impact on the game. Nevertheless, his returns were modest, and his place in the side became untenable, for a few years at least. ",
            "Kapugedara has, however, enjoyed something of a renaissance in T20 cricket, after he was picked in the national side again in 2015. He impressed initially during his second coming, but another round of mixed results saw him in and out of the team. Despite having played top-level cricket for over a decade, he is still relatively young, and it is hoped he may yet come good as a consistent player. ",
            "Naturally aggressive, and capable of clearing the boundary, Kapugedara had been one of the few genuinely exciting batsmen the selectors unearthed from Sri Lanka's Under-19 set-up. From the age of 11, when he first turned out for Dharmaraja College in Kandy, Kapugedera had hardly wasted an opportunity to push himself up the ladder. He had captained all the junior school sides from the U-13 to the first XI. Following a prolific 2003-04 season, where he scored over 1000 runs, he was picked for the U-19 tour to Pakistan the following year and had excelled with a stunning knock of 131 in a one-dayer against the world champions. ",

The selectors, desperate to unearth new talent, eventually gambled on an early promotion and fast-tracked him into the national squad after several glowing reports from development coaches."

It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances. ",

No doubt his penchant to sweep, reverse sweep and hare down that track at spinners helped his cause. Those quick feet have at times failed him behind the stumps - often at crucial junctures. He was recalled to the Indian side for a tour of Bangladesh in 2014 - but his wicketkeeping let him down.",

He was picked in the one-day squad, as replacement for Parthiv Patel in August 2004, and made his debut in a NatWest Challenge game against England where he pulled off a superb stumping. Shortly afterwards, he was called up to make his Test debut against Australia but when he could manage only one fifty in ten matches, he was axed.",
            "He made a comeback in 2008 - picked in the Indian side for all three formats for a tour of New Zealand - but his middling performances continued over the following year and did not allow him to cement a place in the team. He fell out of contention, until a fine 2012-13 domestic season got him back into the ODI side for the 2013 Champions Trophy in England but it proved to be another false dawn."

            "Chakabva represented Zimbabwe in the Afro-Asia Under-19 Cup in 2005, but despite the rebel crisis and subsequent player drain, had to queue up behind the likes of Tatenda Taibu, Brendan Taylor and Richmond Mutumbami for a place in the senior sides. Though he had a disappointing run during the Pakistan Cricket Academy's visit in 2008, he was included in Zimbabwe's squad for their trip to Canada soon afterwards and made his international debut in a T20I against Pakistan in King City. His ODI debut came a week later back in Africa, in the Kenya Tri-Nation tournament, against the hosts.",
            "In 2011, Chakabva made it into the Test XI for the one-off Test against New Zealand in November, but the pivotal point in his career came two years later. In a Logan Cup match against Mid West Rhinos, he cruised to an almost chanceless 240 - his first double-hundred, and the third-highest individual score in the history of the tournament. A grade cricket contract with Farleigh Magpies in Queensland, Australia, followed, marking the beginning of a bountiful year in 2014, in the course of which Chakabva added three more hundreds for Mashonaland Eagles before the end of the season. ",
            "He was one of the few bright points of Zimbabwe's tour of Bangladesh late that year, with a maiden Test century and two fifties. In the two landmark white-ball home series against Bangladesh in 2022, both of which Zimbabwe won, Chakabva starred with his first ODI hundred, in a game where he and Sikandar Raza rescued their team from 49 from 4 to take them to a win in a chase of 291. ",
            "Chakabva served as Zimbabwe white-ball captain for a spell in 2022, including in the ODI in Townsville where they beat Australia for the first time in any format.\n"

But it was his 2016 Under-19 World Cup exploits - 259 runs at 64.75 - that grabbed the selectors' attention and led them to pick him for the senior team's training camp in Sydney ahead of their 2016-17 New Zealand tour.

He is a superb fielder, usually in the covers.",

Consistency was lacking, however, with Chibhabha struggling to convert regular starts into big scores. As such, his appearances for the national side have been marked by their irregularity.",

Kallis is a fine, forceful batsman who has at his disposal both a rock-solid technique and a mind impervious to distraction. Though his role as a bowler diminishes with each passing season, he will be remembered as a purveyor of sometimes surprising pace and swing, and awkward bounce. In the slips, his sure-handedness and rattlesnake reflexes make ridiculous catches look regulation.",

Not even Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne could dislodge him before he had all but saved the match for South Africa.",

Kallis has willingly shouldered the role of the fulcrum around which the wheel must try to turn. But, occasionally, he has unfurled a stroke of startling aggression that hints at what might have been.",

In late 2021 he was recalled for the Ashes series and made a match-defining 85-ball century at the Gabba - it set the tone for a strong of destructive Test innings while he also reemerged as a white-ball force, so central to Australia's 2023 ODI World Cup plans that they waited for him to recover from a broken hand. In the final against India he made 137 off 120 balls. A cult hero was born.",
            "Head earned his first call-up to Australia's squad at the age of 22 for a series of T20Is against India in early 2016 and it was initially the white-ball game where he established himself before Test cricket took over following a debut in 2018. ",
            "He had made his Sheffield Shield debut at the age of 18 in the 2011-12 season and over the next few summers he established his place in the South Australia batting line-up and was a consistent contributor. In February 2015, Head became their youngest captain at the age of 21. He had been viewed as a future leader ever since he captained South Australia to the Under-19 National Championship title in 2012-13 and was named Player of the Championship. As captain of South Australia he showed maturity beyond his years, and in 2015-16 steered them to their first Sheffield Shield final in 20 years.",
            "In 2018 he earned his first Test call-up of part of a new look Australia side which faced Pakistan in the UAE. He played 16 consecutive Tests, scoring a maiden hundred against Sri Lanka in Canberra, before missing the final match of the Ashes series but returned for the home season and notched a second ton in the Boxing Day Test against New Zealand.",
            "He was dropped again midway through the 2020-21 series against India but remained prolific at domestic level. The following season he was preferred ahead of Usman Khawaja for the final middle-order spot and would go on to claim the Compton-Miller medal as Player of the Series despite missing the Sydney Test with Covid. He found life tougher on the subcontinent but it was still a surprising decision to omit him for the first Test against India in early 2023. The absence lasted one match and he was elevated to open the batting. "

Santner was in to cover for the absence of the players at the IPL but made an immediate impression with a well-crafted 94 in a tour game against Somerset. He was handed his ODI debut at Edgbaston having played just 19 List A matches for Northern Districts. \"It's nice to have a left-arm spinner who turns,\" was a quip from the New Zealand camp.",

He also took two wickets. Over the next four years his Test opportunities were limited but he became a mainstay in the white-ball teams for the Black Caps. ",

He won a game by hitting a six off the last ball of the match against Rajasthan and took 2 for 13 from 4 overs in the IPL final against Mumbai, including the prized scalp of Rohit Sharma. ",

            "Later in the same year he recorded a maiden Test century during an epic partnership with BJ Watling. The 261 they added was New Zealand's highest seventh-wicket stand in history and helped their side to 615-9, their highest Test total against England. The three wickets he claimed in England's second-innings also constituted new Test-best figures and helped New Zealand to a crushing innings victory."

That earned him an IPL deal and an Australia call-up. He impressed in a T20I tri-series for the national side before struggling in India.

            "Born in Wales but raised in Barbados, Salt's interests quickly switched from football to cricket. He had watched Manchester City home and away growing up, but the move to the Caribbean inspired a desire to play cricket, and play it aggressively. He won a scholarship to play cricket at Reed School in Surrey, from where he was recommended to Keith Medlycott and joined their academy. He made a first-team debut in August 2015, but it wasn't until 2018 that he really broke through. ",
            "Salt smashed two Championship hundreds from the top of the order - including 148 off 138 balls against Derbyshire - and a strike-rate of 172 in the Blast helped Sussex to the Blast final, which they might well have won but for his calamitous run out in the second over. He was talent-spotted by Lahore Qalandars, who invited him to play in the Abu Dhabi T20 trophy - a Champions League-lite - but Islamabad United swooped to sign him in the PSL draft instead. ",
            "2019 brought two more Championship hundreds, but again it was against the white ball that he impressed the most, smashing a ton in the One-Day Cup and finishing the Blast as Sussex's leading run-scorer. He answered a phone call from the Barbados Tridents from a Miami beach in October, and was soon flying into Trinidad to play in the CPL final - he made a duck, but lifted the trophy regardless. He also became a regular member of Adelaide Strikers' BBL squad, playing under his Sussex coach Jason Gillespie.",
            "The following summer might well have brought him an England debut after he smashed a 58-ball hundred against Ireland in a warm-up game at the Ageas Bowl but they stuck with their tried-and-tested openers and he returned to Sussex for the rest of the season. A winter away with Adelaide and Islamabad brought him limited success as teams worked out his vulnerability against legspin and when he returned to the UK, a freak cycling accident ruled him out of the early rounds of the Championship season. 2021 came to an end without him playing a single red-ball game and coincided with a move that felt like a homecoming: after spending midsummer playing for Manchester Originals in the Hundred, he signed a three-year deal with Lancashire as a replacement for Alex Davies."

He impressed with his smoothness and agility behind the stumps, and made a half-century on Test debut in Colombo. Later that year he scored a plucky 71 against an Australia attack comprising Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill in Hobart. ",
            "When India toured the West Indies in mid-2006, Ramdin's keeping was impressive on pitches where the ball often died even before reaching him. His batting was patchy, though he produced a superb calculated assault on the Indian bowlers in the final stages of the Kingston Test.",
            "Over a period of time his batting became increasingly inconsistent while his wicketkeeping standards dropped a notch. He did make his maiden Test century - 166 against England in Barbados - in March 2009, but that was followed by ordinary performances against Australia and South Africa, which led to him being dropped from the Test and ODI teams.",
            "Ramdin eventually returned to the Test side on the tour to England in 2012. After not doing much with the bat in the first two Tests, he struck an undefeated 107 in the third, but soured the occasion by flashing a note addressed to Viv Richards on the field. Richards had earlier criticised Ramdin's lack of contribution on the tour. Though Ramdin apologised later, the act earned him plenty of criticism, and a fine of 20% of his match fee by the referee.",
            "However, that century did revive his batting fortunes: in the next 18 months, from June 2012 to December 2013, he scored three hundreds in 12 Tests and averaged 53.61; in 44 Tests before that, he had averaged 22.28. His ODI form also saw a spike in 2014, when he scored 516 runs in 13 games, including 169 off 121 balls against Bangladesh in St Kitts - the highest score by a West Indies batter at home.",
            "In May 2014, he replaced Daren Sammy as Test captain, and led West Indies in 13 Tests, of which they won four, drew two, and lost seven, before Jason Holder took over. Ramdin's tenure ended following West Indies' 2-0 loss at home against Australia in 2015.",

",

The slow left-arm bowling, always canny and relying more on variations in pace than on sharp turn, became the support act, though 440 international wickets will tell you that he was pretty adept at what he did.",
            "Jayasuriya, who had trawled the lower reaches of the middle order till then, had his first stint as ODI opener during the Hero Cup in India in 1993, and established himself in the role during a home series against Pakistan the following year. By the time the World Cup rolled around in 1996 he had already chalked up his first century in Tests, a frenetic stroke-filled effort in Adelaide. ",
            "People remember Aravinda de Silva's magical innings from the semi-final and final of  the 1996 World Cup but it was Jayasuriya's withering assaults that deflated India in Delhi and England in the last eight. Soon after, he began to exact as heavy a toll on Test attacks, scoring at such a pace that Muthiah Muralidaran and friends had ample time to work their way through opposition batters.",
            "Jayasuriya had a four-year stint as captain that ended with a semi-final appearance at the 2003 World Cup, and just as the whispers grew about diminishing returns with the bat, he had one of his most successful years in 2004. There was a retirement announcement  in 2006, but he was back within weeks, finally walking off the Test stage 18 months later, after a typically cavalier 78 in Kandy.",
            "In one-dayers, he took Sri Lanka to another World Cup final in 2007, and he was instrumental in the Asia Cup win of 2008, a couple of months after it had seemed that the selectors' axe had fallen for the final time. The IPL gave him a new platform to showcase his big-hitting talent, but failure to replicate the success of the first season in subsequent campaigns was the sign that time had finally caught up. ",
            "Jayasuriya's election as a member of parliament in April 2010 and his subsequent failure at the T20 World Cup suggested his international career might have ended, but he made the longlist for the 30-man squad for the 2011 World Cup, though he didn't play in the tournament. His last ODI and T20I came weeks shy of his 42nd birthday, in England later that year.\n"

            "The sense that Liam Livingstone is a domineering batting talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was strengthened by an excellent maiden Championship double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 2017. He had begun the season billed as the \"belligerent face of England's next generation\" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine.",
            "Crafting his game did not go well in 2018. He broke a thumb in the Roses match in July which did not help (bizarrely reappearing to bat with a short leg pad as protection) and failed to reach fifty in 10 Championship matches as Lancashire were relegated under his captaincy. He recovered in time for Finals Day in the T20 Blast where his hundred in 49 balls against Derbyshire had provided his greatest satisfaction in a summer he would want to forget.",
            "He gave up the captaincy at the end of the season and over the next three years embarked on a globe-trotting T20 journey, ticking off the majority of the world's franchise leagues during English winters to expose himself to different conditions and roles. His form led to an ODI debut in early 2021 and a T20I recall exactly four years after his debut against Sri Lanka. The following month, he blitzed the fastest-ever T20I hundred by an Englishman, off 42 balls against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, then cleared the new stand at Headingley and embarked on a six-hitting rampage in the first season of the Hundred.",
            "Livingstone, a hard-hitting batsman from Barrow in Cumbria, won a trophy in his first season in Lancashire colours when they triumphed at Edgbaston on Finals Day in the 2015 NatWest Blast. His satisfaction did not come without mishap, however, after he was glassed (and deemed an innocent party) in a late-night incident in an Ashford bar after the quarter-final win against Kent and needed around 20 stitches. A first-ball duck, bowled by Northants' Shahid Afridi, added to his misery in the final, but Lancashire were hopeful that, at the very least, they had a big hitter on their hands.",
            "He had first attracted media attention as the season began by striking 350 in 138 balls for his club side Nantwich in a mismatch which saw them beat Caldy by 500 runs. It was held to be one of the largest individual scores in any officially-sanctioned limited-overs fixture. "

            "A prodigious turner of the ball, teenage legspinner Shadab Khan burst onto cricket's collective consciousness only during the 2016/17 PSL season. His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career.",
            "Shadab has made an immediate impact; he only played his maiden first-class game ten months ago, in July 2016. His ability with the U-19 side caught PSL franchise Islamabad United's eye, who gave the young leggie a chance he accepted with aplomb. His performance during the competition won him praise from the likes of Wasim Akram and Misbah-ul-Haq, and saw him called up to Pakistan's limited-overs side for the tour to the West Indies. His meteoric rise continued as he flourished in the first two T20Is, taking seven wickets for 21 runs and winning the Man-of-the-Match award on both occasions."

            "Salman Butt's career will forever be associated with the events at Lord's in August 2010, when - as Pakistan captain - he was implicated along with his new-ball bowlers Mohammad Asif and Amir in a betting scam involving the deliberate bowling of no-balls. A sting instigated by the News of the World led to a ten-year ban by the ICC, before on November 1, he was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy to accept corrupt payments and conspiracy to cheat. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.",
            "Until his downfall, Butt drew comparisons with the legendary Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar, because he is left-handed and possessed of some supple wrists, His drives and cuts  through the arc between extra cover and backward point were inevitably flicked, often scooped and it was a high-scoring region. He didn't mind pulling either and off his toes, he was efficient rather than whippy as Anwar was. Further, like Anwar, Butt's footwork didn't really hold him back. But in attitude and temperament Butt was more Anwar's long-time partner, Aamir Sohail. ",
            "He had a confident  air about him, a spikiness and is one of the few younger players confident when speaking English. His breakthrough period was the winter of 2004, where he first scored an ODI century against India at Eden Gardens and then went further by scoring a fifty and a maiden Test century in Sydney later in the year. For most of 2005, he failed to build on that and despite another ODI century, also against India, doubts about his defensive technique and overt dash crept in, resulting in him dropping in and out of the team. But against England to end the year, he responded to criticism by unveiling a startling restraint and change of tempo, hitting a century and two fifties in the Tests, each innings commendably restrained. Though his consistency isn't up to the mark, he still remains a vital member of the Test team. Following the disastrous tour of Australia in 2009-10, where senior players were slapped with serious punishments by the PCB, Butt came through unharmed and was given the vice- captaincy for the Asia Cup and England tour in 2010.",
            "He had made impressive strides at age-level matches before making his Test debut against Bangladesh in 2003-04, playing in the Under-19 World Cup and touring South Africa with Pakistan's Academy team, smashing 233 against the South African Academy side. His strokeplay has never been in doubt and he is capable of providing electrifying starts when needed but with the tightening of his defense, Butt could be one half of the opening conundrum that has so haunted Pakistan since...well, Anwar and Sohail left the scene.",
            "2010 became a significant year for him as he finally cemented his place in all three formats and eventually succeeded Shahid Afridi as Test captain. But after winning much praise for his leadership on and off the field - and leading Pakistan to Test wins against Australia and England - his career was rocked by charges of involvement in spot-fixing and, in February 2011, he was handed a ten-year ban (with five years suspended) by the ICC. He was then tried at the Southwark Crown Court in London in October, and found guilty of cheating and accepting corrupt payments on November 1."

In making an unbeaten 84 he exhausted every ounce of strength, talent and willpower and then when he imagined it might be all over he came out to bat once more to help win a Super Over by the narrowest of margins.",
            "For Stokes, this was a wonderful moment of redemption because it had been his misfortune until then to be remembered for two episodes he would rather forget. The first came in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final in Kolkata. Asked to defend 19 in the last over against West Indies, his attempted yorkers missed the mark by inches resulting in Carlos Brathwaite heaving him for four successive sixes into a sweltering night sky.",
            "The second, and altogether more serious, incident occurred in September 2017. Celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Stokes became embroiled in a fight outside a club in the early hours of the morning that resulted in his arrest. A trial at Bristol Crown Court subsequently saw him cleared of the charge of affray but by then the reputational damage had been done. He had already missed the 2017-18 Ashes tour - a toothless England were beaten 4-0 with Stokes not considered for selection - and been stripped of the team's vice-captaincy. ",
            "It was testament to his immense character that he ensured he would be remembered for more positive reasons. Within months of his comeback, Stokes had played a key role in England's 3-0 Test win in Sri Lanka, their first whitewash series victory in Asia. Trevor Bayliss praised Stokes' attitude as \"exemplary\", saying he had \"learned his lesson\". The World Cup final underlined his immense character. Capable of turning games with his batting, his bowling and in the field, he had attracted comparisons with Ian Botham. Expectations were huge from the outset. He had satisfied them.",
            "Stokes, from the moment he made his Durham debut, felt very much a product of the northeast of England. He was actually born in Christchurch, New Zealand and came from a rich sporting pedigree with his father, Ged, playing international Rugby League for that country.",
            "His prodigious talent was clear from an early age. A true allrounder, Stokes debuted for Durham at 17 and dismissed Mark Ramprakash with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. He enjoyed a productive time at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham. But it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over, and a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact.",
            "A first brush with the management was to follow, after being called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013. Stokes ended up being sent home with three matches remaining, along with Kent's Matt Coles, after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment, and he was rapidly rehabilitated back at Durham, playing a key role in their Championship-winning season and being recalled to England's limited-overs teams. He took a maiden ODI five-for and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, a return to Australia that would command attention for the right reasons.",
            "Stokes' performances were a rare bright spot on a disastrous trip. When the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England as a star on the rise. Brought into the XI at Adelaide, after Jonathan Trott's untimely departure, his pugnacious nature came to the fore during a maiden Test hundred in Perth, a doughty response out of keeping with England's general demeanour throughout the tour.",
            "But with fire came combustibility. Stokes missed the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after reacting to a dismissal in Barbados by punching a dressing room locker and sustaining a broken wrist. During a difficult year, he was dropped from the Test team after making three ducks in a row against India, and then lost his one-day place on the tour of Sri Lanka - ultimately missing out on selection for the 2015 World Cup.",
            "Stokes, like England after a dismal tournament, needed rejuvenating. It began with the Lord's Test against New Zealand, when Stokes scored 92 and 101 after being promoted to bat at No. 6. A successful Ashes followed and he was also a central figure in the new-look ODI side that began to put the World Cup behind them under the guidance of Bayliss and Paul Farbrace. A few months later he produced a barnstorming 258 from 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town - the fastest England double-hundred in history and the second fastest of all time - during a stand of 399 with Jonny Bairstow.",
            "Following his Kolkata nightmare, he nevertheless grew in stature within the side and was promoted to the vice-captaincy (at least until the Bristol episode). He scored his maiden ODI hundred in Dhaka in late 2016 and added four more across international formats the following year, while also taking Test-best figures of 6 for 22 against West Indies at Lord's, becoming a key cog for England despite a chequered injury record."

            "Paul Collingwood was never the most gifted cricketer to play for England, but there was so much to admire for all that. That he was a cricketer of substance was undeniable. As his county career came to an end in 2018, at the age of 42, he symbolised how much could be achieved by pluck, good sense and a deal of athleticism. ",
            "A natural athlete with a happy-go-lucky temperament, Collingwood became the first England captain to ever deliver a global tournament when England beat Australia to win the 2010 World Twenty20. It was reward for nine years of uncomplaining professionalism, in which time he fought his way through a melee of seemingly more talented opponents to make himself indispensable in all forms of the game.",
            "It took a long time to prise out Collingwood from the middle. More than seven years after the end of his England career, he retired with quite a record: he represented Durham in 23 of their 26 years in professional cricket and amassed 304 first-class appearances, 16,844 runs and 164 wickets.\nIn common with Marcus Trescothick at Somerset, he grew into one of the grand old stagers of the county circuit, communicating that England's professional circuit remained a place where international stars who had known the best could still find satisfaction. A phlegmatic, hard-working, get-the-job-done cricketer, he squeezed value from himself to the very last drop.\nHe called time on his England Test career at the end of the 2010-11 Ashes series, finishing on a high by becoming a three-times Ashes winner, and by the time he ended his ODI career two months later, he was England's leading ODI run scorer and most capped player. But his contribution was far from spent: he went on to lead Durham to the Championship in 2013 and his growing reputation as one of England's old sages was amplified when he accepted a part-time coaching role with Scotland and guided them to the World Cup finals. An opportunity working as England's fielding coach under Ashley Giles began his gradual shift in the later stages of his career from player to coach.",
            "Collingwood's greatest asset was his ability to contribute to the team in several aspects. As a batsman, he stands still at the crease, plays the ball straight and has a tantalising range of strokes up his sleeve. His bowling verged towards the dibbly-dobbly, but given the right conditions he could be irresistible, as he proved with a matchwinning display of swing bowling in the third one-day game against New Zealand in 2001-02. As a fielder, he was one of the finest in the world, capable of breathtaking moments in the covers and backward point. The final tick in his column was his determination, which made him go to Melbourne in the winter of 2000-01 to play grade cricket when he realised he was treading water.",
            "For the first few years in his international career he seemed destined to be a fill-in player. But at Lahore in the winter of 2005, he stuck 96 and 80 before hitting a brilliant maiden century at Nagpur with England in the middle of an injury crisis. He kicked on to become the rock of England's batting on the subsequent Ashes tour. His brilliant double-century at Adelaide ought to have been the defining moment of his career. Instead it was the preamble to one of the most devastating defeats in English Test history. But after an understandable period of introspection, Collingwood bounced back with consecutive one-day centuries to secure the CB Series. It was England's first overseas one-day trophy for nine years, and his subsequent appointment to the captaincy in June 2007 was met with unanimous approval. He cemented the role with memorable victories over India at home and Sri Lanka away.",
            "A slump in form in 2008 led to his omission from the Test team and his resignation as ODI captain, but he took back the reins for the World Twenty20 in 2009, a decision that didn't look too prudent when England were embarrassed by the Netherlands in the opening match of the tournament. But less than a year later England had developed into a ruthless power-packed Twenty20 side. Led by Collingwood, their blend of fearless hitting with dynamite fielding and thoughtful bowling brushed aside all challenges as England won the tournament. They got there in style - beating Australia in the final - with Collingwood finishing the job with the winning runs.",
            "A difficult summer followed, where Collingwood struggled to come to terms with the seam and swing of Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif. His batting form failed to improve during England's historic Ashes success the winter after but his fielding remained exemplary - setting the benchmark for England's high standards. In the final Ashes Test in Sydney he dismissed Michael Hussey in the first innings, sparking wild celebrations. And with England on the verge of a 3-1 triumph, he chose to retire from Test cricket, calling time on a successful Test career which many thought would never happen. He had hoped to keep playing limited-overs cricket for England but a poor World Cup followed the Ashes and he was subsequently dropped from both England's teams and replaced as Twenty20 captain by Stuart Broad.",
            "After considering retirement from all cricket, he decided to continue with Durham and succeeded Phil Mustard as captain in 2012, winning an impressive seven of his first 10 matches at the helm as steering Durham from bottom of the table to safety. A Championship title duly followed in 2013 as he reinvigorated Durham in a manner few seriously expected. When some bad investments made life harder in 2014 he still led Durham to the Royal London One-Day Cup and picked up the Player of the Year award for good measure. He had become a wonderful ambassador for county cricket, but Durham were stricken by financial problems and when the ECB was forced to bail them out, as a last resort, at the end of 2016 they did so with stringent penalties - relegation from Division One of the Championship included - intended to give a warning message to others. Collingwood termed it \"a kick in the nuts\", but Durham could also learn from his ability to squeeze maximum benefit from the toughest situations.",
            "That relegation brought a rush of departures, but while Collingwood was still standing there was still hope. He made 1,000 Championship runs in 2017 and became the oldest player to make a T20 hundred and Durham's first century-maker in that format, against Worcestershire at New Road.  Aged 41 years & 65 days, Collingwood beat ex-Worcestershire player Graeme Hick (41y 37d) who struck 110 against Northamptonshire in 2007. A rush of Durham awards followed. A season later, with the county showing signs of recovery, he felt able to call time."

            "Tall, aggressive, and powerful, Dwayne Smith shares his name with, among others, the wide receiver for the Wisconsin Badgers, and the winner of the 2002 World Championship of Public Speaking. But when, in December 2003, he was called up to join the West Indian Test squad in South Africa, he was arguably as well known in cricket circles as either of them. All that changed, however, on the final day of the third Test at Newlands, where he brought the calypso back to Caribbean cricket with a wonderful debut century. Smith had been given a surprise opportunity - ahead of his Grenadian namesake Devon - when Marlon Samuels flew home with a knee injury. It was rumoured that Viv Richards had recognised something of himself in the stance of the young Barbadian and, sure enough, he needed just 93 balls to justify his selection, bringing up his hundred with a crashing cover-drive. It was only the second century of Smith's first-class career, but it was enough to stem West Indies' run of seven consecutive defeats in South Africa. ",
            "Maintaining such high standards for longer periods was difficult for Smith. He played his last Test for West Indies in May 2006, but continues to be active in limited-overs cricket. He made the West Indies XI in only one of their matches when they won the World T20 in 2012, but was their designated opening batsman in the next edition of the tournament. He was part of the squad that played a home World Cup in 2007 and he was there again, eight years later, when the tournament was held in Australia. "

            "Morkel's limited-overs prowess made him one of the biggest buys at the inaugural IPL auction. Morkel sold for US$675,000 to Chennai Super Kings. He made his name as a reliable lower-order allrounder and was retained by the franchise for several seasons. ",
            "By 2010, Morkel was only playing ODI cricket sporadically for South Africa but the shortest format was keeping his career alive. He was part of the 2010, 2012 and 2014 World T20 squads; the last of those tournaments seemed to spell the end of his international career. "

            "Michael Lumb was a fallible, but on his day a talented and highly destructive left-handed opener whose finest moment came as part of England's victorious squad in World Twenty20 in 2010. Lumb's confident strokeplay was not short of swagger and was just what England needed at the top of the order as they sought to bring more vigour to their short-form game. No respecter of tradition, he was also one of the first England cricketers to make unabashed calls for the ECB to introduce a city-based Twenty20 tournament. ",
            "Lumb, the son of prolific Yorkshire opener Richard Lumb, was born in South Africa and made his way through the junior teams in Transvaal before returning to his roots to play for Yorkshire. A hard-hitting batsman, he made his county debut in 2000, scoring 66 not out against the touring Zimbabweans. A knee injury in 2001 meant that he played only a small part in Yorkshire's success in winning the county championship that year, although he did record a maiden first-class hundred against Leicestershire. In doing so he became part of only the fourth father and son pair to score centuries for Yorkshire.",
            "He made progress in 2002 by becoming a regular member of both the Championship and limited-overs sides and in 2003 scored close to a thousand first-class runs at an average of over 40, including two centuries and six fifties. He was selected for the ECB National Academy squad the following winter, but has failed to progress to Yorkshire's expectations and was dropped during the 2005 season.  Although he averaged in the middle-thirties in 2006 with a top score of 144 he decided to leave at the end of the season and joined Hampshire.",
            "The move galvanised his career, and his prolific Twenty20 form in 2009, where he made 442 runs from 11 games as Hampshire won the Friends Provident Trophy, including a blistering unbeaten 124 from 69 balls against Essex, earned him a $50,000 IPL contract with Rajasthan Royals.  It proved to be the launch-pad to higher achievements.",
            "On the back of an unbeaten 58 to guide England Lions to victory against the senior team in a warm-up match in Dubai, he was called in as the latest incarnation of England's Twenty20 specialist opener for the World Twenty20 in Caribbean in May 2010. His selection was a revelation as, despite a top score of 33, he routinely muscled brisk starts which set the tone that carried England to their first ever triumph in a global limited-overs event.",
            "Injury disrupted his 2011 season, the final year of his contract  with Hampshire, but he was identified by Nottinghamshire as batsman who could bolster an unreliable top order in four-day cricket and director of cricket Mick Newell, who remembered Lumb's career-best Championship score of 219 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 2010, signed him on a three-year contract. ",
            "His debut season for Nottinghamshire yielded more than 1,400 runs across all formats, including 910 in the Championship.  Although he did not make the starting XI in any of their matches, Lumb regained his place in the England Twenty20 squad in time for the defence of the World Twenty20 before playing a starring role for Sydney Sixers in the Champions League in South Africa, hitting an unbeaten 82 off 42 balls as the Australian franchise beat Lions by 10 wickets in the final.",
            "Suspicions that Lumb might increasingly become a T20 specialist were confounded in 2013 when he returned more than 1,000 Championship runs. He skipped the IPL auction in 2014, saying he had \"ticked that box\" but England - and Sydney - retained an interest in his T20 skills and he was named in England's squad for World T20 in Bangladesh.",
            "Lumb teamed up with Riki Wessels in 2016 to set what was a new record stand for a List A game in England: 342 in 39.2 overs in a Royal London Cup game against Northants at Trent Bridge, beating the 318 amassed by India's Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly against Sri Lanka in Taunton in the 1999 World Cup. Lumb, who made 184, commented that it was one of those days \"when the stars were all aligned\". Nottinghamshire's 445 for 8 in their 50 overs was the second highest total in List A matches worldwide at the time. Astonishingly, despite being stricken by injuries, Northants got within 20 runs. Lumb also hit the mark with a 17-ball T20 50 against Leicestershire, one of the fastest in Notts' history, but his poor Championship form had much in keeping with a Notts relegation season.",
            "Lumb's final summer came in Notts' triumphant 2017 season when they added promotion in the Championship to both limited-overs trophies. He was part of the Notts side that beat Surrey in the Royal London Cup final at Lord's, but then retired later that month because of an ankle injury. "

            "In the winter of 2022-23, Harry Brook announced himself as one of the world's most exciting young players with a staggering run of form across formats, most particularly in England's rebooted Test team. After making his debut against South Africa in September 2022, Brook travelled to Pakistan and New Zealand with Ben Stokes' team, where he peeled off consecutive scores of 153, 87, 9, 111, 89, 54, and 186 to take his overall tally to 809 runs in nine innings, at an extraordinary strike-rate of 98.77. No player in Test history had started with a bigger bang - Vinod Kambli had 796 runs after his own ninth innings - and not even Brook's anticlimactic tenth innings (run out without facing in England's thrilling one-run defeat at Wellington) could take the gloss off his achievement. ",
            "By then, Brook was also a T20 World Cup winner, after featuring in England's triumph in Australia earlier in the winter, and at the IPL auction in December, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 13.25 crore (£1.3 million).",
            "A former England U19s captain, Brook had flickered in Yorkshire colours over the first couple of years of his professional career, most notably when scoring a maiden first-class hundred at Chelmsford in 2018, as the visitors recovered from being bowled out for 50 in their first innings to inflict defeat on reigning champions Essex. He recorded a List A hundred at the start of Yorkshire's 2019 Royal London Cup campaign, and showed signs of greater consistency the following summer when he averaged 43.00 in the Bob Willis Trophy.",
            "But his form in the Blast - first as a finisher in 2020, then shifting up to No. 4 in 2021 - was enough for him to be touted as a future England player, and an innings of 62 from 31 balls in the Northern Superchargers' first Hundred game led Stokes to echo that sentiment. He is particularly strong against seamers, hitting down the ground, or over midwicket and the covers, and has become innovative too, reverse-lapping and scooping in the death overs.",
            "Brook, an orderly young batsman, won 1st XI recognition midway through 2017 courtesy of an impressive run of scores in the second team, the highlight of which was a matchwinning century in a one-day final against Middlesex at Headingley. A product of the Burley-in-Wharfedale club, and Sedburgh School, Brook had already toured India with England Under-19s at that stage and he captained them later in the year in 50-over cricket in the return series against the Indians."

            "He made his Test debut at Old Trafford in 2007 and took 7 for 66 in the second innings - a performance that included three wickets in one over. In the next two years, Sammy struggled to hold down a place in the Test side but remained a fairly permanent fixture in the one-day team. ",
            "Playing for a weakened team against Bangladesh in 2009, he ended the two-Test series with 12 wickets. Further success with the ball came on Zimbabwe's tour of the Caribbean in 2010, when he became the first West Indian to take five wickets in a T20I. West Indies went on to lose that game, but Sammy's bowling in the one-day series that followed - he took eight wickets at 12.50 and an economy rate of just 2.85 - was a major factor in the home side's win. He was also one of the bright spots in West Indies' whitewashing by the South Africans later that year, although this time it was his batting that grabbed the attention: he scored at a strike rate of 145.31, and registered the fastest half-century by a West Indian at the time, in the second ODI in North Sound. ",
            "After Chris Gayle did not sign a central contract in 2010, Sammy was named captain of the Test and one-day teams, and he led West Indies to their first Test win in two years, taking seven wickets against Pakistan in Providence in 2011, but overall the results were disappointing. Though West Indies won six in a row - against New Zealand (at home), Bangladesh and Zimbabwe - they then lost heavily against India and New Zealand (away). Sammy's batting and bowling performances were less than impressive and he was replaced as Test captain by Denesh Ramdin in May 2014.",

His Dutch descent allowed him to represent Netherlands and qualify under the EU law to play county cricket. With his huge hitting, skiddy bowling and big smile, he soon became a cult figure at Essex, where he played for nearly two decades, twice captained the team to the Championship title, and proved himself one of the team's finest players of his era.",

He passed 1000 first-class runs in a season for the first time in 2016, and bowled only occasionally as captaincy took his focus. That season he and new coach Chris Silverwood took the team back into Division One of the Championship. Ten Doeschate led by example, averaging 64 with the bat, making four hundreds, and fittingly, scoring the runs that won promotion.

            "Like a number of players before him, Craig Kieswetter, a hard-hitting wicketkeeper-batsman, chose England ahead of South Africa. He joined Somerset when he was 18 and made his international debut four years later, little more than a week after qualifying for England. He was briefly England's answer at the top of the order, helping them win the 2010 World Twenty20 and rise up the one-day rankings. But his form stuttered and he was dropped after the India tour in January 2013. He returned to the squad at the 2014 World T20 but failed to add to his 46 one-day internationals and 25 T20Is. During the subsequent English season, he suffered a sickening blow in the face, breaking his nose and damaging his eye socket while batting against Northants when a delivery from David Willey burst through his grille. It forced him into retirement in June 2015 as he conceded defeat to impaired vision and what he indicated was psychological trauma. \"I feel I will never be mentally the player I was,\" he said.",
            "He played for South Africa at the 2006 Under-19 World Cup before coming to Millfield School. He made his Somerset first-team debut in April 2007, scoring 69 not out off 58 balls and taking a catch his coach described as \"world class\". The batsmen-friendly conditions at Taunton aided his attacking instincts and in the 2009 English season, his last before he qualified, he scored 1,242 runs at a 59.14 in the County Championship as well as averaging almost 50 in one-day cricket.",
            "The selectors, who had been watching for some time, rewarded him with a place on the Lions tour of UAE although Geoff Miller did caution that England \"had to be careful about the number of South Africans in the side\". Yet Kieswetter was undeterred and repeated his allegiance to England when Graeme Smith said he'd like to him to come back to South Africa.",
            "The day after he became eligible for England in February 2010 he hit 81 against the senior side in Abu Dhabi, enough to earn a rapid elevation to the full squad for Bangladesh where his first innings of the tour was the small matter of 143. It was a promising sign. He made a century in his third ODI, against Bangladesh before playing a crucial role in delivering England's first ever global limited-overs success in the World Twenty20. Alongside Michael Lumb, Kieswetter powered England to aggressive starts, making 222 runs in the tournament, the fourth-highest tally, including a Man-of-the-Match winning 63 in the final against Australia.",
            "But that proved his high water mark. In his next 18 T20s for England, Kieswetter made only two half-centuries and was eventually dropped for the crucial World T20 tie against Sri Lanka in 2012. Jos Buttler, his county team-mate, took his place and Buttler eventually usurped him from the ODI side too.",
            "In 2013, a battle ensued between Kieswetter and Buttler for the gloves at Somerset but Kieswetter did enough to earn the No. 1 slot with over 500 runs in the Friends Life t20 - form that earned him a deal in the Australian Big Bash League - an average of 56.80 in the Yorkshire Bank 40 and 31.89 in first-class cricket. Buttler left for Lancashire at the end of the season.",
            "Kieswetter initially thrived in the ODI side, averaging 51.00 in the five-match series at home to Sri Lanka in 2011 but in his next 23 innings made only two half-centuries. Struggling in India could be forgiven and he didn't get too many chances in subsequent series that England dominated against Pakistan and Australia as he was moved down the order. But with his wicketkeeping not the sharpest, the calls for change grew after a top score of 33 in four innings against South Africa. He went back to India in January 2013 but was dropped for the final two ODIs and was then left out of the tour to New Zealand under new one-day coach Ashley Giles.",
            "He had initially hoped to fully recover from his injury, sustained when struck by a short delivery from Willey. He returned at the end of 2015 season and then went to play domestic T20 in South Africa, but struggled with the after-effects of the injury and announced he would not be playing the 2015 English season."

He scores runs with his wrist and bottom hand, takes pace off the ball when he bowls, and prowls the field from the point or cover region. ",
            "Behardien got himself noticed in the 2011-12 season when he averaged 45.66 in the domestic limited-overs competition and 66.60 in the 20-over version. He was named the South African T20 player of the year at the 2012 awards, a label that helped push him through the door and into the national side.",
            "He made his T20 debut in March 2012 and was included in the squad to play the World T20 in Sri Lanka that year. An ODI call-up came in January 2013 and he made more of an impact in the 50-over format at first. He scored his first half-century in his fourth match and also proved himself as a viable option to share the fifth-bowler duties. He was part of the squad that travelled to the 2013 Champions Trophy but did not play a game and it was only later, on tours to Sri Lanka and Australia, that he established himself as a regular. ",
            "Consistency was hard to come by in a top-heavy line up that often left Behardien limited opportunity, but he took the chances he could. He had to switch between providing middle-order stability and taking on the finishing role and often found himself fighting to keep his place, especially in T20 cricket. He was part of the 2016 World T20 squad and only played once as South Africa were eliminated before the knockouts. That year, he also got his first IPL deal, with Kings XI Punjab."

            "The son of former allrounder Rod Latham, Tom Latham played varied roles for New Zealand since his international debut at the age of 19. He batted in every position from No. 1 to 9 in limited-overs cricket, and also took on the responsibility of being a wicketkeeper. In Tests, however, Latham was primarily used as an opening batsman, and he quickly settled into a position New Zealand had trouble filling for years.",
            "Latham had been part of New Zealand's Under-19 World Cup squad in 2010 and later that year he played first-class cricket for Canterbury. In 2012, he made his debut in ODIs and Twenty20 internationals and was shuffled up and down the order for a while but did not cement his spot. ",
            "Following an impressive domestic season, Latham played his first Test, against India in Wellington, in February 2014 and was picked as an opener for the tour of West Indies a few months later. In the Caribbean, he reeled off three successive half-centuries, contributing to an overseas series win. Against Pakistan in the UAE that November, Latham scored centuries in successive Tests, the first New Zealand batsman to do so for 24 years. He has been a fixture at the top of New Zealand's order in Test cricket ever since. In December 2018, he carried his bat in a Test innings against Sri Lanka in Wellington, making 264 not out to set a new Test match record for the highest score by any opener while carrying his bat, surpassing Alastair Cook's 244 not out in 2017 against Australia. He was also only the second New Zealand opener to carry his bat in a Test. Glenn Turner had previously done it twice. ",
            "In ODI cricket, he was included in New Zealand's 2015 World Cup squad, but did not get a game as Brendon McCullum's team finished runners-up. However, New Zealand rested several first-choice players from the tour to Africa later that year, and Latham cashed in: he made his maiden ODI hundred in Zimbabwe, and scored three successive half-centuries in South Africa - all while opening the batting. He had had only one 50-plus score in his first 26 ODI innings. "

            "Vusi Sibanda is a contemporary of Tatenda Taibu, Hamilton Masakadza and Stuart Matsikenyeri. Like them, he comes from the Harare township of Highfield and earned a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School. Sibanda is an opening batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler, and was a student at the CFX Academy in 2002. He scored 58 on debut against the West Indies, but his selection for the national team came too early, and despite failing to live up to his potential, the crisis in the national side meant that he kept his place long after others would have been discarded. Despite being a superb timer of the ball off both the front and back feet, he was slow to learn the ability to build a big innings and his selections were due almost entirely to his outstanding potential rather than actual performance. He has a very sound technique, but poor shot selection has often brought about his downfall. Coach Kevin Curran noted that he matured well on the West Indian tour in May 2006. He suffered a hand injury early on, but took his opportunities when given them, starting the tour with 52 at Georgetown, and finishing with a 78 and then a superb century in the Tri-Series final against Bermuda. ",
            "He had a successful club season in Sydney, Australia, which seemed to have paid dividends when he registered scores of 47, 93 not out, and 64 in the home series against Bangladesh in February 2007. He could not carry this form into the World Cup, however, and his only innings of note in the tournament was 67 in Zimbabwe's tied game against Ireland at Kingston. He returned to Australian club cricket after the World Cup amid questions over his commitment to international cricket, but subsequently returned to Zimbabwe and was selected for the Afro-Asia Cup, making some impressive starts without being able to push on for a big score. He narrowly missed out on a first ODI hundred against a Test-playing nation when he was run out for 96 against the West Indies in Bulawayo in December 2007, and remained in contention for the national side thereafter with the odd good innings.

Unsurprisingly, his first international foray was in the T20 format. Having earned a reputation as a heavy hitter in New Zealand's domestic T20 competition, de Grandhomme earned a debut against his native Zimbabwe in 2012. He did not sufficiently impress to keep his place on that occasion, but continued to flourish on the domestic circuit. ",
            "In 2016, an unbeaten fourth-innings 144 off 147 balls, to lead Auckland's successful chase of 373, put him back into national reckoning, this time in the Test format. But it was with the ball that he left his first significant impression on international cricket; his 6 for 41 against Pakistan on a Christchurch green-top were the best figures for a New Zealand debutant, bettering a 65-year-old record. ",
            "From then on he was a fairly regular member of the New Zealand team in all three forms. He made his first Test century against West Indies in December 2017. He played a significant role in the 2019 World Cup, making a brilliant 47-ball 60 in a nail-biting winning chase against South Africa and 64 against Pakistan. In the extraordinary final against England, he was unplayable at times while bowling a vital spell taking 1 for 25 from 10 overs including the prized wicket of Joe Root. ",
            "De Grandhomme had represented Zimbabwe at the Under-19 World Cup in 2003-04, and broke into the Manicaland side in 2004-05 before ascending to Zimbabwe A and Zimbabwe Under-23s, for whom he scored a century against Eastern Province in the SAA Provincial Challenge. Soon, though, de Grandhomme felt his future lay outside Zimbabwe, and he quickly made a mark in Auckland. In 2008-09, he averaged 54.50 with the bat and 24.19 with the ball as Auckland won the State Championship."

            "Jason Holder was seen as a future talent until a selection panel headed by former World Cup-winner Clive Lloyd appointed him West Indies' ODI captain in 2014. Holder was only 23 at the time, and was still making his way as a fast bowler and a lower-middle order batsman. Less than a year later, he took over the Test team too, indicating how much the WICB and men in the know - ranging from Viv Richards to Brian Lara to Tony Cozier - believed in this man, who comes across as remarkably level-headed and mature for someone so young. ",
            "A reliable batsman and a steady medium-pacer - both suits being works in progress - Holder was born in Barbados and was the recipient of the prestigious Lord Gavron Award in 2009. He played one first-class game before being called up for the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, where he was his team's leading wicket-taker with 13 wickets. He replaced the injured Tino Best for West Indies' limited-overs leg of the Bangladesh tour in 2011, and made his international debut in Australia a few months later. A Test debut came against New Zealand in Bridgetown in June 2014, and he took two wickets and made a fighting 52 at No. 7. He had been signed by Chennai Super Kings in the 2013 IPL auction, but was dropped. However, in 2016, he was picked up by Kolkata Knight Riders.",
            "At 6 feet and seven inches tall, Holder is a soft-spoken man, and so there were questions over his ability to lead a team of older and vastly more experienced cricketers. His maiden Test century - against England in April 2015 - showcased his mental strength. West Indies were 189 for 6 when he came in to bat at No. 8 and his 214-minute defiance saved the match for his team. On a tour of Australia in 2015-16, his authority seemed to come into question when stories of his bowlers refusing to bowl into the wind surfaced, but Holder quashed them on Twitter saying, \"Be careful what you read! My fast bowlers had a tough game but every time I called on them they came up and gave effort. Never once refused!\""

            "A tidy left-arm spinner and hard-hitting batter, Roelof van der Merwe is one of a small set of cricketers to have represented two international teams.",
            "Van der Merwe played in the 2004 Under-19 World Cup for South Africa before he made his domestic debut in 2006 for Northerns. He first tasted success in franchise cricket with Titans in the 2007-08 season, when he topped the wicket-takers' chart in the MTN Domestic Championship, finished third in the Standard Bank Pro20 Series, and contributed handy runs in both tournaments. Titans won both titles and van der Merwe harvested a clutch of player-of-the-year titles. The following season, his 30 wickets were pivotal in the team retaining the MTN title.",
            "He marked his T20I debut, against Australia in 2009 with a quickfire 48 and 1 for 30 and was named Player of the Match. He played 26 games, split evenly between ODIs and T20Is over a year, for South Africa before calling time on his international career with them. Between then and when he first turned out for Netherlands in 2015, having acquired a Dutch passport, he plied his trade as a T20 journeyman, with gigs in the IPL with Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils, and with Somerset in England's T20 Blast, while still appearing for Titans.",
            "Van der Merwe got off to a brisk start in T20Is for Netherlands, taking two wickets apiece in each of his first four games, in 2015. In June 2019, he produced a breakneck 75 not out against Zimbabwe, and in the game after, took 4 for 35 - though Zimbabwe won that match in the eliminator after it was tied.",
            "As he entered his late 30s, van der Merwe continued to ply his trade around the world, though primarily as a bowler as his batting became less consistent. At the T20 World Cup in 2022, playing for Netherlands, he took a stunning high catch off David Miller to help his side secure a famous victory - one which knocked his old team, South Africa, out of the tournament before the semi-finals."

            "A batsman of great talent and enormous ambition, Michael Clarke emerged in Australia's golden years, was with them through the troughs that followed, and eventually led them back to the No.1 Test ranking. At his peak Clarke was ranked the best Test batsman in the world, testament not only to his skill but his hard work in overcoming a chronic back injury that caused him progressively more trouble as his career advanced. Also an intuitive, aggressive captain, Clarke took over from Ricky Ponting in 2011 and while the team did not always run harmoniously during his tenure, he was at the helm for an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14 and a World Cup triumph in 2015. His retirement came at the end of a lost Ashes campaign in England in 2015, but he could be satisfied with a career punctuated by fine achievements.",
            "As a young man Clarke could do anything with the bat, but he matured into one of the game's most professional, reliable and focussed players. A year into his Test career he learnt that he had to shed the flourishes that made him a golden child in order to shine consistently at elite level. Breathtaking centuries on debut away and at home stamped him as a shot-maker to savour, but his method in later years was to find gaps by caressing the ball along the ground. In the field his throw was as fast and accurate as anything in the game, and he could winkle out batsmen with his disarming left-arm spin. ",
            "Mostly he became known for his immaculate driving and slicing of the ball through impossible angles. His peak year was 2012, which brought 1595 runs at 106.33 and stamped him as the most in-form batsman in the world. The year began with a monumental 329 not out against India at the SCG and continued with 210 in Adelaide, where he joined Wally Hammond and Don Bradman as the only men to score a triple-century and a double-hundred in the same series. Later in the year came back-to-back double-centuries against South Africa in Brisbane and Adelaide. There seemed little he could not do.",
            "But the team harmony disintegrated on the tour of India that followed in 2013, when Clarke and coach Mickey Arthur suspended four players in what became known as the homework saga. The Ashes series in England was then lost, but Clarke's Australians regained the urn with a 5-0 clean sweep in Australia at the end of the year. Clarke's gutsy century in Cape Town in 2014, completed with a broken shoulder thanks to a bouncer barrage from Morne Morkel, led to Australia's return to No.1, if only temporarily. Later in the year a statesmanlike Clarke led the country in mourning the death of his close friend Phillip Hughes, and an emotional century in Adelaide followed in what Clarke called the most important match of his career.",
            "Although Clarke's ability and dedication could never be questioned, he nevertheless struggled at times to win over sections of the public, due in part to his A-list celebrity status, large endorsements and high-profile private life. There were occasions when he was booed in his own country, and at times he was accused of being too aloof around the team environment. But whatever his off-field status, Clarke will be remembered as a batsman of class and a captain who took the game on, and emerged with an enviable record in both spheres.\n\n"

Anderson had already appeared for Canterbury the previous year and, within a year, he had played for New Zealand A, as well as in the State final. A left-arm pace bowler and middle-order batsman, Anderson played in the Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2008 and two years later again made the squad for the tournament, which was held at home in New Zealand.",
            "Anderson made his first-class debut in 2007, but had to wait till 2012 for his maiden first-class century. It was a big hundred, though - 167 against Otago - and soon after that he was included in New Zealand's squad for the Twenty20 international series in South Africa. He didn't do much in that series, and was injured for the subsequent one-dayers - a continuation of fitness issues that have followed him through the early part of his career - but continued to score runs in the domestic season. In 2013, he was included in New Zealand's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy, and made his debut in that format against England in Cardiff."

            "Debuting as a 31-year-old in 2014 for his adopted country of Oman, Mohammad Nadeem took a while to get going, making his first half-century in international cricket shortly before his 36th birthday, against Hong Kong at the 2018 Asia Cup Qualifier in Malaysia. ",
            "Since then he has rewarded the faith of Oman's management by transforming into an indispensable middle-order allrounder. There is nothing flashy about his batting technique, but his ability to soak up pressure in tense situations and get Oman across the line with a string of valuable not-outs was instrumental in their progress through the final stages of the World Cricket League ladder to secure ODI status in April 2019. ",
            "As for his bowling, Nadeem's slow jog into the crease belies the consistent 130-135kph pace he is able to generate - at times he has been clocked above 140kph - by flinging the ball in with his wiry frame. In a team that has been frequently loaded with quality frontline fast-bowling options, his presence has allowed Oman to leave one out in favour of an extra spinner when conditions have called for it without suffering much of a drop-off in pace quality. Though he may not be a full quota bowler, his strike rate is indicative of his effectiveness at creating breakthroughs when called upon, particularly in the middle overs.\n"

            "Dissed when he first appeared, Ravindra Jadeja won the doubters and haters over with his deeds, and now sits among the elite of Indian spin bowling.",
            "In October 2019 he became the quickest left-arm bowler to reach 200 Test wickets. Six years before that, he had became the first Indian since Anil Kumble in 1993 to top the ICC ODI bowling rankings. In the IPL, he drew a scarcely believable bid of US$2 million in 2012. ",
            "In an era in which he was bound to be overshadowed by the artistry of fellow spinner R Ashwin, Jadeja kept his senior colleague on his toes, and often stole the spot when conditions allowed India to play just the one spinner. It helped that he was a captain's dream: arguably the fastest man on the turf and the best fielder in the time that he played, he went on to become an important lower-order batter. ",
            "Some of his best batting performances came against the top teams, and they were often accompanied by the swordsman's celebration that became his signature. Ten years into his career, he had five Test fifties and a hundred against England - the latter in a partnership of 222 with Rishabh Pant at Edgbaston in 2022 - and four half-centuries against Australia. It was all a far cry from the memes his batting inspired at the start of his career - though the ridicule directed at his three triple-hundreds in domestic cricket back then was more an indictment of the quality of bowling on the Indian first-class circuit at the time. ",
            "Jadeja shone in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win, finishing as the leading wicket-taker, with 12 wickets, two of those in the final, where he also made an unbeaten 33.",
            "His most valuable assets as a bowler are perhaps his fitness and strength, which enable him to go at batters for hours, ready to pounce on any assistance from the pitch. Like with his batting, his bowling highlights too feature the best sides disproportionately. His first Test five-for came against Australia in Delhi in 2013, and was followed by 6 for 138 in his next match, against South Africa in Durban, though that was in an India defeat. When South Africa next visited India, he got stuck into them, with 23 wickets in the four Tests in 2015. Against England at home in 2016-17, he harvested 26; this included an impressive demolition job in Chennai, where he took 7 for 48 after India had racked up 759 runs. Later that season he took 25 wickets when Australia visited for four Tests, to go with the 24 from the previous time, in 2013. ",
            "Through the first half of his career and beyond, Jadeja's place in the Test side was never quite secure. He had to fight through a serious shoulder injury, and he was even dropped from the squad, but he kept coming back. Of course, these hardships paled in comparison with a tough childhood in Jamnagar, and the hard knocks that marked his early career, including being banned by the IPL for a year for essentially trying to negotiate his salary. In that tournament, Jadeja has been synonymous with Chennai Super Kings, for whom he has taken over 100 wickets over nine seasons and whom he briefly captained in 2022.\n"

Injury kept him out of the squad for the World Cup the following year, though he had just made 87 in a T20I in the Caribbean and was in the running to replace Alex Hales in the national team. The year ended more encouragingly when he was named vice-captain of a new-look England T20I side for the tour of New Zealand - though he failed with the bat on that assignment, which meant he was left out of the side that went to South Africa at Christmas time.\n "

            "Niall O'Brien, a left-handed batsman and wicketkeeper renowned for his competitiveness and relentless chirping behind the stumps, played the innings that forced the cricketing world to take note of Ireland. His magnificent 72, which were over three-quarters of Ireland's runs while he was at the crease, underpinned the St Patrick's Day victory over Pakistan in the 2007 World Cup. He later contributed 63 against England in the tournament. He went on to be one of Ireland's most capped players.",
            "As a player for Kent, O'Brien was already known to many of the English players. But when Geraint Jones lost his England place it led to O'Brien being released by Kent, and he moved to Northamptonshire at the start of the 2008 season.  He enjoyed considerable success at the county, being named as Northants' Player of the Year at the end of the 2008 season and securing a three-year contract. After Nicky Boje relinquished the captaincy and Andrew Hall took up the position, O'Brien was named as his deputy. He was stripped of the position and banned from the team, however, for a breach of team disciplinary rules in June 2010. Although he was subsequently cleared at a disciplinary hearing and restored to the squad he no longer held the position of vice-captain and a fractured finger kept him out of action for most of the season. ",
            "Despite continuing to perform consistently - he averaged 35.72 in first-class cricket for Northants - O'Brien moved to Leicestershire at the start of the 2013 season on a three-year contract, where his experience brought solidity to a vulnerable batting line-up. In 2014 he scored 971 first-class runs, his highest tally in an English season. He retired from county cricket at the end of 2016 as his 35th birthday approached and took up a career opportunity in talent management. Although he planned to settle in Leicestershire, he had plans to play for Leinster Lightning in the new first-class competition scheduled for 2017 and did not retire from international cricket.",
            "The son of Brendan, a former Ireland captain, Niall has played alongside Kevin, his younger brother for Ireland. But he played in the Bangladesh Premier League, against Cricket Ireland's wishes, at the start of 2012. He was left out of the subsequent World T20 Qualifiers and, when he regained his place in the side, found that he had been usurped by Gary Wilson behind the stumps and has yet to regain the gloves. "

Although less heralded at the time, Ackermann was a former South Africa U-19 who had topped the Sunfoil averages in 2016-17, and might have been in contention for a Test call-up had he not taken the well-trodden English county route.",
            "His returns in county cricket were mostly solid rather than spectacular, and when he did grab the headlines it was with his occasional offspin - figures of 7 for 18 in a T20 Blast game against Birmingham Bears making him the first man to take a seven-wicket haul in the format. He captained the T20 team in his first season at Leicestershire, taking on the job full-time the following year, and in 2019 stepped up to lead the 50-over side; as well as topping the run charts in both limited-overs formats. The following summer he was unveiled as club captain, a sign of his growing importance to the county, and in 2022 he made history as his career-best 277 not out helped Leicestershire to their highest first-class score, 756 for 4 dec, and a Championship-record fifth-wicket stand of 477 with Wiaan Mulder (235 not out)",
            "Ackermann had previous experience in the county of Leicestershire after enjoying a successful season for Kibworth in 2012. He is a product of Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, with whom he toured England. He was the leading run-scorer in the CSA Under-19 three-day competition in 2009, where he averaged 200 with two centuries."

            "James Franklin began his New Zealand career as a left-arm medium-fast bowler who could swing the ball, before morphing into an effective allrounder, particularly in limited-overs cricket. He was introduced to international cricket when barely out of his teens after New Zealand suffered a run of injuries, making his one-day debut in 2000-01 and playing two home Tests against Pakistan the same season, but he struggled to make an impact and lost his place after the Sharjah Cup in April 2002. Back in domestic cricket he worked on his batting, which he had neglected, and filled out generally. ",
            "He returned to the side in England in 2004. He was playing league cricket in Lancashire, but was called up when Shane Bond went home with a back injury. Franklin was included for the third Test at Trent Bridge, and although New Zealand lost he did his cause no harm with six wickets, five of them Test century-makers. He stayed on for the one-dayers that followed, and picked up the match award at Chester-le-Street for his 5 for 42 as England were skittled for 101. ",
            "He was retained for the tour of Bangladesh, and took a hat-trick at Dhaka. Back home he took 6 for 119 against Australia in March 2005, and bowled superbly - getting the ball to reverse-swing - against Sri Lanka a month later, although his figures didn't reflect his excellence. More wickets followed against West Indies, then in April 2006 Franklin did his allrounder claims no harm with an unbeaten 122 - and a stand of 256 with Stephen Fleming - against South Africa at Cape Town.",
            "A knee injury hampered his 2006-07 season and he underwent surgery for a patella tendon injury in his right knee. Franklin eased back into competitive cricket by playing Twenty20 and one-day games for Australian Capital Territory and representing New Zealand in the Emerging Players tour of Queensland in October 2008. He made his first-class comeback for Wellington in November with 69 and 4 for 56 in his team's innings victory over Canterbury.",
            "He returned to the international team later the same year but struggled to nail down a permanent place, despite performing strongly in county cricket for Gloucestershire in 2009 and 2010. He was part of the New Zealand side that made it to the semi-finals of the 2011 World Cup and expressed his disappointment at missing out on a central contract, though he regained a deal the following year. By this point, Franklin had developed into an allrounder capable of scoring useful runs down the order and bowling economical spells and he remains a fixture in the T20 and ODI teams, although a Test return was less successful.",
            "Middlesex signed Franklin in 2015 as an on-overseas player thanks to his Irish ancestry, effectively bringing about his retirement from international cricket. Adam Voges' call-up by Australia meant that he soon assumed the captaincy, a role he held when Middlesex won their first title for 23 years in 2016 - the title settled on the final afternoon in a contrived declaration against Yorkshire with the prize of the Championship to the winners. The contrivance ended Somerset's hopes of their first title and Franklin, who defended the artificial finale, received broad support."

            "With a wide range of strokes and an ability to time the ball shared by few, it was understandable that England's selectors kept providing opportunities to James Vince.",
            "Despite a supporting role in the World Cup triumph - he won a late call-up as first reserve batsmen when the team management lost patience with Alex Hales and went on to play three matches in the tournament - there was still a sense that, after more than 30 international appearances and despite his undoubted elegance, Vince has promised rather more than has delivered in several opportunities in the England side. ",
            "Vince was first given the summer of 2016 to prove that he had the ability to succeed at England level. Sadly, appearances - initially at least - proved misleading. In seven Tests, against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, he averaged 19.27 without a half-century and was repeatedly fallible on the drive outside off stump. Only one Championship hundred for Hampshire added to his mournful air. Vince did manage an ODI half-century against Sri Lanka and showed more promise in T20Is, but those who had lobbied long and hard for his inclusion were particularly disappointed with the outcome of his first international summer as his undoubted style was not matched by substance. Even then they insisted that statistics showed that his ill luck was that he tended to play and edge rather than play and miss.",
            "But Vince was not to be denied so easily - or at least Vince's advocates weren't. He only averaged 33 in the Championship in 2017, but still found himself on the plane to Australia after England's selectors observed the failure of Tom Westley, and others, to make the No 3 position their own and turned to Vince once again. Simmering talent or habitual maker of soft 20s and 30s? It seemed that England were about to find out.",
            "He began with an impressive 83 in Brisbane before he was run out, but only passed 50 once in his next eight innings. Despite 76 in Christchurch in a drawn Test in New Zealand, he was axed again in the English summer even though England were struggling for top-order options. England's new national selector, Ed Smith, seemed to want proof of desire at Hampshire. He responded with 201 from 437 balls against Somerset at Taunton but was overlooked all the same, he topped Hampshire's averages, and his 50-over cricket included a sublime 171 against Yorkshire but his defiance waned and he ended the season feebly with no score above 30 in his last nine innings.",
            "A Wiltshire boy who found his way into the Hampshire set up, he was first tipped as a star of the future when the former England coach Duncan Fletcher, who worked with Vince at the Hampshire academy, said he was reminiscent of Michael Vaughan. Like Vaughan, an adherence to sound technique does little to temper his attacking instincts. To attract England's interest more regularly, though, he needed to answer a perception that he suffers a greater proportion of soft dismissals than a player of his ability should.",
            "Vince has enjoyed one-day success with Hampshire, his red ball cricket has slowly advanced and he has been a regular in the England Lions squad, impressing with his methodical approach.",
            "After he broke into the Hampshire side in 2009 he averaged over 50 in his first round of limited-overs matches before impressing again for England at the Under-19 World Cup. He became a First XI regular in 2010, and in August of that year confirmed his pedigree with an innings of 180 against a Yorkshire attack that included Ajmal Shahzad, Tim Bresnan and Adil Rashid at Scarborough. In that innings he added 278 with Jimmy Adams, breaking Hampshire's fourth-wicket record which had stood since 1970. ",
            "Vince went past 1000 career runs for Hampshire while still a teenager - the second youngest player in the county's history behind Phil Mead to do so. In 2012 he averaged 55.50 as Hampshire won the Clydesdale Bank 40, the second part of a one-day double. 2013 saw great improvement in the County Championship and he passed 1000 first-class runs in a season for the first time. That winter he toured Sri Lanka with England Lions and during the following close season in 2014-15, was picked for the Lions trip to South Africa.",
            "Vince enjoyed a stand-out season in 2014 after being named Hampshire vice-captain. He made a mighty 1525 runs - the highest tally in the country - at 61.00 as Hampshire won Division Two of the County Championship and also made a superb 93 from just 51 balls to steer his side to victory in a T20 quarter-final at Notts. ",
            "His career progressed substantially in 2015 when he made his England one-day debut against Ireland in May and was named as captain of the Lions T20 squad to face Pakistan A in Dubai in December. He also assumed the Hampshire captaincy in all formats at only 24, hailed by his chairman Rod Bransgrove as \"a genuinely gifted and creative captain with a maturity beyond his years.\"",
            "Ahead of the 2015 season it was announced that Vince would become captain for both limited-overs formats, assuming the 50-over captaincy from Jimmy Adams. By the end of the summer, he had replaced Adams in all three formats only for his career to falter when England came calling."

Abandoned by his separated parents, Ryder spent his teenage years bouncing around friends' houses and sleeping in their couches. Along the way he began playing indoor cricket, and turned out to be pretty damn good at it. Those formative years without boundaries or direction also formed the basis of the alcohol trouble that has been a companion almost throughout his adult life.",
            "If that hint of vulnerability, that rebellious streak, that human touch in an increasingly robotic world of sport, endeared Ryder to the public, the failure to keep that promise of talent and the tendency to not learn from indiscretions frustrated in equal measure. At his best Ryder makes batting look easy, bowls decent dibbly dobblies, fields superbly at gully (don't believe Adam Parore who said Ryder was too fat to play for New Zealand), spends hours signing autographs for kids, and is a shy little kid when in public. When not at his best he has got into ugly bar incidents, has signed for Ireland when on the verge of breaking into the New Zealand side, has got into drinking trouble again and again, and has played only 18 Tests and 48 ODIs after making his debut in 2008.",
            "In 2012, working closely with friend and manager Aaron Klee, Ryder decided that playing international cricket put too stern a demand on him psychologically and emotionally, and went on a sabbatical. He worked hard, got fitter, got therapy, boxed a little, came back to domestic cricket, and just when it seemed he was approaching a happy space in life he was assaulted brutally outside a suburban Christchurch bar in March 2013. He was in for more trouble later in the year, when he was banned six months for consuming a banned substance: the New Zealand Sports Tribunal ruled Ryder had consumed the substance unwittingly, as part of a pill supplement for his weight-reduction programme, and he was suspended till October."

            "As a batsman, the trouble with Ashraful has been his inconsistency. As long as you enjoy the highlight reel of his career, everything seems rosy: whether it was in becoming the youngest Test centurion in 2001, the unbeaten 158 against India in 2004, the magnificent 100 he made against Australia in Cardiff in 2005 triggering a huge upset, or the innovative 87 against South Africa in the 2007 World Cup, Ashraful provided the entertainment quotient that turned heads towards Bangladesh.

The fact that he has a score of 50 or more roughly 15% of the time he has batted in international cricket is one of those markers, like his batting average, that pulls him down as a batsman. Is it easy to say that he has underachieved, but those who have dealt with him over the years think otherwise, as they have been surprised by his own lack of confidence in his immense talent.",
            "His rise from the outskirts of Dhaka to cricket's wonderboy has been well documented. He trained under Wahidul Gani, a dedicated coach who ran his academy in Dhanmondi, before making his club debut for Amorjyoti. After warming the benches for the star-studded Surjo Tarun in the Dhaka Premier League in 2000-01, he made it to the Bangladesh team on the back of a lot of promise and because the selectors were too focused on youth.",
            "After his 2007 World Cup performance, the media wanted to see their golden boy take to captaincy, but it didn't work out well. He immediately fell further as a batsman in his two-year stint that also saw the loss of players to the Indian Cricket League in 2008. There were allegations of him being willing to play in the rebel league. He lost his captaincy to Mashrafe Mortaza after his affinity for a dab past the wicketkeeper cost Bangladesh a game against Ireland in the 2009 World Twenty20. And as the team started to have more performers, he lost his place regularly in the next few years. However, in March 2013, he made 190 against Sri Lanka in the Galle Test, an evolved innings which earned fulsome praise."

It wasn't entirely his fault though. For 30 years, the position behind the stumps was the domain of Khaled Mashud or Mushfiqur Rahim. ",
            "Nurul made his T20I debut in January 2016, against Zimbabwe, one of many experiments that the selectors indulged in ahead of the Asia Cup and the World T20. His ODI debut was equally accidental as Mushfiqur sustained a hamstring injury on the tour of New Zealand in December. Nurul was only the fifth wicketkeeper to make an ODI debut since Mushfiqur's career began in 2006. ",
            "Nurul spent three years at the Under-19 level, playing in two World Cups in 2010 and 2012. He broke through in the 2013-14 season, making 489 runs in the National Cricket League, averaging 81.50 with two centuries. It earned him a place in the Bangladesh A side and then a reputation as a solid performer in domestic cricket."

            "One of Pakistan's modern batting greats, Younis Khan is the kind of man who responds best in adversity. A Test average of over 50, a triple-hundred, a famous double-hundred against India in India, and a brilliant rearguard partnership to clinch Pakistan's 3-0 Test whitewash over England, leave no doubt about his quality and class. He is also one of the most successful fielders for Pakistan, and can bowl respectable slow-medium. As a captain, Younis has enjoyed success in leading Pakistan to the world Twenty20 title in 2009.",
            "Much of his persona evokes the idea of the quintessential Pathan warrior - committed, inspired, capable, and bearing the burden of conflict with fortitude and poise. Born in Mardan, a prominent city in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Younis moved at an early age to Karachi, where he caught the eye of Rashid Latif and Saeed Anwar at Malir Gymkhana, one of the city's renowned sports clubs. The relationship with Latif blossomed into a nurturing mentorship, guiding Younis towards entry onto the world stage. After two impressive domestic seasons, he got a Test call-up, and marked it with a century on debut.",
            "Style and aesthetics are not his strongest points. His technique relies on a good deal of bottom hand, which deprives it of the fluidity and grace that is typical of Asia's best batsmen. Yet when Younis gets going, he produces results in the face of steep odds.",
            "Indeed, the steeper the odds, the more Younis seems to thrive. His match-winning 267 and 84 not out in Bangalore came after a string of low scores prompted a sarcastic comment from the team manager that leaked into the media. His greatest captaincy feat - the world Twenty20 championship in England - was achieved weeks after Pakistan cricket had been devastated by the terror attacks in Lahore. And though his triple-century came at home on a flat track, the innings began under pressure when Younis, eschewing the nightwatchman, stepped out himself in the dying moments of the second day with Pakistan staring at a huge Sri Lankan total. Unsurprisingly for a rearguard specialist, Younis has emerged a master of the fourth innings. Among players with 1000 or more fourth-innings Test runs, his average is among the highest."

            "Jordan's career looked to be going nowhere at the end of 2012 when he was released by Surrey, but he made his international debut less than a year later. He enjoyed a run in England's white-ball sides in the games following the 2013-14 Ashes tour, and was given a Test debut the following summer.",
            "He played only twice in the ignominious 2015 World Cup, but had shown enough promise in an England shirt to survive the cull following that tournament. He lost his place in the ODI squad in 2016, but was impressive in the World T20 in India that year: but for Carlos Brathwaite's last-gasp heroics, the fact he went for only eight runs in the 19th over of the final would surely have been remembered more fondly.",
            "Jordan remained a lock in England T20I team, and his performance in a series in the Caribbean immediately before the 2019 World Cup nearly brought him in from the wilderness. But his close friend Jofra Archer was named in the eventual squad ahead of him, and he continued to forge a path on the global franchise circuit.",
            "Jordan, a right-arm quick bowler born in the home of fast bowling, Barbados, was first spotted in his native land by Bill Athey, who was scouting for a recipient of a cricket scholarship back in England at Dulwich College. He became an exciting prospect at Surrey but failed to emerge as the bowler the county had hoped, not helped by a troubled period in the county's affairs.",
            "Jordan was earmarked for great things after Nadeem Shahid, Surrey's Second XI coach, saw five minutes of his all-round ability. Shahid immediately called then first XI coach Alan Butcher to tell him they had a gem on their books. Five days later Jordan was at first-team nets. He impressed there and blazed into Surrey's team in August 2007, looking the part immediately at just 18 years old. ",
            "It was a hugely promising start with 20 wickets at 24.50 before the year was out but in the following seasons, injuries and inconsistency stalled his career and he missed the whole of 2010 with a back problem. His return in 2011 produced only 11 wickets at 48.00 in the Championship but that winter returned to play for Barbados and his potential was again evident. But back with Surrey in 2012 his impact was minimal and he was released at the end of the season. He went back to Barbados, with the question looming of who he might play for internationally, and excelled again. ",
            "A move to Sussex in 2013 saw his true potential come to the fore, and England soon took notice. Eligible for England through his grandmother, he was selected for two England Lions fixtures in 2013 - meaning he would have to undertake a qualifying period to play for West Indies - and travelled with the full England ODI squad to Dublin. An ODI debut at the Ageas Bowl against Australia soon followed, before he broke through on the post-Ashes tour that winter. ",
            "He continued to impress with the ball for Sussex across formats, and has played T20 cricket in the majority of leagues around the world, including the IPL. A useful lower-order batsman, Jordan hit a maiden first-class ton against Essex at Colchester in 2016, and has regularly found himself clearing the ropes to bail England out of trouble. He is also a world-class fielder, whether called upon in the slips, in the outfield, or off his own bowling. "

            "The player he eventually became was not quite the Prince, but a talented left-hand batter with the same walk, the same backlift, the same flourish, the same footwork, the same mannerisms, and incredibly, for a while, the same stats as well - their runs and batting average were identical after their first 12 Tests. ",
            "But Bravo's career hasn't been as prolific thereafter, partly due to disagreements with the West Indies board (not that Lara didn't have his fair share of those).",
            "For all his talent, Bravo, who is the half-brother of West Indies' legendary allrounder Dwayne Bravo, took a while to get to his first international hundred. But once he got going, two years after his debut, he reeled off three Test centuries in the space of a month, starting with 195 in Mirpur, followed by 136 in Kolkata and 166 in Mumbai in 2011. ",

            "But when he pulled out of part of the white-ball leg of the New Zealand series, a tour of South Africa in 2014, and later, the 2016 T20 World Cup, it looked unlikely that he would succeed Shivnarine Chanderpaul as West Indies' batting mainstay. ",
            "In 2016, he was sent home from an ODI tri-series in Zimbabwe after he referred to board chairman Dave Cameron as a \"big idiot\" for suggesting that Bravo was offered a grade C contract due to his slipping batting average. Bravo's contract was revoked, and in response, he launched a damages claim against the WICB. He returned to international cricket in 2018, and scored a Test half-century in a ten-wicket win over England in Antigua early the following year.\n"

            "Ed Joyce is best known as the Ireland batsman who played for two different countries in successive World Cups. Joyce had switched to England when the 2007 World Cup took place, having helped Irelands through the qualifying tournament, and became the first Irishman in the modern game to play for England. But he did not quite achieve the career he had envisaged and switched back to Ireland just in time for the next tournament in 2011. He had not quite achieved the four-year qualification period, but the ICC recognised a persuasive case and gave him special dispensation. ",
            "Joyce was born in Dublin, and from a large family with four brothers and four sisters. He was a star for Ireland at ICC Trophy level, scoring 758 runs in 14 matches between 2001 and 2005, at an average of 84.22. But he always had ambitions to play at the highest level and, after completing his English residency qualification in 2005, made his one-day debut against Ireland in 2006. The Irish team included his younger brother, Dominick. Two days later, he represented England in his first Twenty20 International, before missing a month with a sprained ankle. International cricket, though, had whet his appetite and upon his Championship return for Middlesex at Edgbaston he struck a career-best 211 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.",
            "He seemed to cement his England place with good performances in Australia - the highlight being a century against Australia at the SCG and then against lesser opponents in the 2007 World Cup, although questions began to be raised about his fluency and he was discarded after England's dismal tournament. Joyce was an important part of Middlesex's middle-order for a decade from his debut in 1999, but his frustration at a stalled England career was evident and after an unhappy 2008 he severed his ties with Middlesex and moved south to Sussex where he became an influential member of the side without ever regaining his England place. ",
            "He became Sussex captain in the middle of the 2012 season, succeeding Michael Yardy. He had an exceptional summer in 2014, hitting seven centuries and averaging 66 in the Division One of the Championship, outdone only by Yorkshire's Adam Lyth among regular performers.  The England selector Angus Fraser even suggested that, were Joyce still eligible, he would have been seriously considered as Alastair Cook's opening partner in the Test side. He resigned after Sussex were surprisingly relegated in 2015, leaving Luke Wright to pick up the role in all three formats. The advent of first-class cricket in Ireland left him unsure of his Sussex future at the end of 2016, a season in which he set a new career-best with a masterful 250 against Derbyshire in Derby.",
            "An oddity in Joyce's career was a rare form of dismissal in a Championship game against Warwickshire in 2009 when he swept a ball from Ant Botha straight into the pocket of the fielder at short leg, Jonathan Trott, who was leaping to take evasive action at the time.",
            "Once Joyce recognised his England career was over, without the Test debut he had craved, he made clear his intentions to return to an international career with Ireland. He was named in an Irish pre-World Cup touring squad in October 2010 - more than five years after his last outing for Ireland - and shortly afterwards was granted special dispensation by the ICC to represent his country of birth at the tournament in February 2011. He explained that he had been driven to qualify for England by his desire to play Test cricket - \"the pinnacle of the game\" - but that as a \"born and bred Irishman\" he was eager to contribute to Ireland's success if that chance of Test cricket eluded him.",
            "He is one of five members of the Joyce family to represent Ireland. Two brothers, Gus and Dom, and twin sisters Isobel and Cecelia, have also done so, with Isobel also captaining the Ireland women's team."

            "Modern Australian wicketkeepers are renowned for being tough and uncompromising, and Brad Haddin was a fitting inheritor of the job held by the likes of Rod Marsh and Ian Healy. His immediate predecessor was Adam Gilchrist, whose presence prevented Haddin from making his Test debut until the age of 30. However, Haddin made up for lost time by eventually becoming vice-captain to Michael Clarke and a key senior figure in a developing side. Never was he more important than in during the 2013-14 Ashes clean-sweep, when he bailed Australia out of tricky positions in every first innings of the campaign. His 493 runs at 61.62 put him second only to David Warner on the run tally and he was nimble behind the stumps, and it was only Mitchell Johnson's reign of terror that prevented Haddin being Player of the Series.",
            "By 2014, he was again Australia's preferred keeper in all three formats after two years earlier being usurped by Matthew Wade in all three. Haddin had originally lost his Test spot to Wade after flying home from the 2012 West Indies tour when his 17-month-old daughter Mia was diagnosed with cancer. At 34, it seemed as though his international career might be over, but Haddin showed his dedication by returning to domestic cricket and winning back his place for the 2013 Ashes tour, when Australia's selectors wanted his experience and poise. Renowned as a loyal team man who could be brusque with the media, Haddin was a valuable lieutenant and sounding board for Clarke during the back-to-back Ashes series.",
            "Haddin's first taste of Test cricket had come in the West Indies in 2008, when he played through the pain of a broken finger. Flaws in his keeping were on show in India in 2008 but his glovework gradually improved, and a batting breakthrough in 2008-09 gave him confidence. In his 16th Test innings he passed 50 for the first time and went on to 169 against New Zealand in Adelaide, showing flashes Gilchrist would have accepted. An important one-day batsman who shuffled around the order, Haddin also had the chance to captain Australia in T20s in 2009 when Ricky Ponting, Clarke and Michael Hussey were rested. He was also starting to prove himself a productive Test run-maker, which continued on the 2009 Ashes tour with 121 in Cardiff and 80 at Lord's, where he also gave up 20 byes as he struggled to deal with the late movement. A broken finger gave Graham Manou an opening at Edgbaston, but Haddin returned for the final two Tests. ",
            "He remained a useful batting contributor in 2009-10 but his highlight was the spectacular, one-handed take at full stretch down the legside off Salman Butt. It was a hugely impressive catch that helped Australia to an unbelievable win at the SCG in 2009-10. (New Zealand supporters find it hard to forget the glove-assisted bowled of Neil Broom in a one-day game the previous summer.) Another injury, a batting-related elbow problem, rubbed him out of the Pakistan series in England, where Tim Paine was used, and after 136 in the opening Ashes Test of 2010-11, Haddin endured a more difficult period in 2011. Notably, he was one of the major culprits in Australia's 47 all out in Cape Town, when at 18 for 5 he backed away and tried to drive Vernon Philander on the up through the off side, gifting South Africa a sixth wicket. A lean home series against India followed, before Wade took his place in the West Indies."

            "Acclaimed by Rod Marsh as the best teenage batter he had ever seen, Ponting began with Tasmania at 17 and Australia at 20, and was given out unluckily for 96 on his Test debut in 1995. There were some teething problems in the early years, including a public admission of an alcohol problem, but the longer he went on, the more he matured, piling up the runs and records. He finished with 27,483 runs and 71 hundreds in international cricket, the second-most prolific Test scorer when he retired, behind Sachin Tendulkar. ",
            "Ponting played all the shots with a full flourish of the bat - the cover drive and the pull were particularly productive for him - and knew only to attack. His breathtaking, dead-eye fielding was a force in the game by itself. ",
            "The batting highlights included an average of 54 from 29 Tests against India, boosted by two thunderous double-centuries in consecutive matches in 2003, which fetched him a series aggregate of 706 runs, and another double in his last series against them in 2012. Against the old enemy, England, he started with a hundred at Headingley in 1997 in his first Test against them that not only lifted Australia from 50 for 4 but also helped take them to a massive win of the sort they would trademark in the decade or so to come. In the 2002-03 Ashes mauling, Ponting was to the fore with hundreds in the first two Tests; his 156 to wrest a draw at Old Trafford in 2005 was an epic in a series filled to the brim with them; and he gorged himself In the 5-0 whitewash of 2006-07 with 196 and 142 in Brisbane and Adelaide, and two fifties besides. Those performances came at the tail end of a run that started 11 months earlier, during which he made eight hundreds in nine Tests. Between 2002 and 2008, he only went two years without scoring at least 1000 runs apiece in Tests. In ODIs he pulled the feat off in six years, including 2003, when in the World Cup final he pummelled 140 unbeaten runs against India, taking the title off them before their chase had even started.",
            "As captain, Ponting was a little less dominantly successful, but his record was magnificent all the same: 48 wins in 77 Tests gave him a win percentage second only to Steve Waugh in the game's history, despite defeats in three Ashes series and against South Africa and India. He also led Australia to 26 consecutive undefeated (completed) 50-over World Cup games, stepping down from the captaincy when that run ended, in the 2011 World Cup. For the first three years of his reign he was in charge of a superstar unit and did not have to do a whole lot tactically, but once the core of that team retired he had to change from a manager to moulder. ",
            "After his retirement, Ponting turned to coaching, with three years at the helm of Mumbai Indians in the IPL, including during their title win in 2015. In 2018, he took over as coach of the Delhi franchise.\n"

He is perhaps as gifted as any sportsman can be. He is also as poorly equipped for the trials of daily life as any human being can safely be. Dark tales of marijuana smoking, drunk driving and match-fixing have blotted his career. Gibbs is about as close as cricket has come to producing a punk rocker, a figure who veers too close to self-destruction too often for the likes of those who prefer their cricketers unblemished by the real world."

            "- Rashid Khan became the first Afghan player to play in the IPL when he debuted for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the IPL 2017 curtain-raiser.",
            "- After five seasons with SRH, he was snapped by Gujarat Titans (GT) in 2022, helping them win the IPL in their debut season. ",
            "- In 2023, Rashid had his best season at the IPL yet, finishing second on the wickets charts with 27. On his way there, he registered the 22nd hat-trick in IPL history, dismissing Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Shardul Thakur in three balls for Titans against KKR. ",
            "- Before the start of IPL 2024, among bowlers with 50 or more wickets in the Indian Premier League, Rashid was the most economical of all (an economy of 6.66 from 109 games between 2017 and 2023).",
            "Rashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket. His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. ",
            "Not a big turner of the ball, he puts batters under pressure with his speed through the air, like his bowling idol Shahid Afridi, while maintaining a stump-to-stump line. His biggest weapon is an accurate googly, and he has variations aplenty. With bat in hand he is more than capable of clearing the boundary late in an innings, and he has airbrushed many a middling total into a match-winning one for his team. ",
            "Rashid was just 17 when he made his ODI debut on Afghanistan's tour of Zimbabwe in October 2015. Less than two years later, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL for close to US$600,000. After a superb 17-wicket first season with them, he picked up franchise deals with Guyana Amazon Warriors - for whom he took the first-ever hat-trick in the CPL in 2017 - and Adelaide Strikers, with whom he won his (and their) first BBL title in 2018. He scaled new heights for Afghanistan as well, taking 5 for 3 in a T20I against Ireland to keep a record 11-match T20I winning streak alive, and later in 2017, taking his country to a win over West Indies in their first ODI in the Caribbean with 7 for 18. He was duly honoured as the 2017 ICC Associate Cricketer of the Year. ",
            "The following year, he became the youngest cricketer to top the ODI bowling rankings, the youngest man to captain an international side, and the fastest to 100 ODI wickets.",
            "In Afghanistan's inaugural year in Test cricket, Rashid took five second-innings wickets in their first win, against Ireland, and six months later made an important fifty and took twin five-fors, finishing with 11 wickets in a famous win over Bangladesh in Chattogram. In 2021, he took 11 again, this time in a win over Zimbabwe. ",
            "In his five seasons with Sunrisers, he was a totemic presence, taking 93 wickets at an economy rate of 6.33. When he moved to Gujarat Titans in 2022, he took 19 wickets in a run that led the side to the title.\n"

            "Virender Sehwag has constructed an extraordinary career with a relentless quest, and a genius, for boundary hitting. With minimal footwork but maximum intent, he has piled Test runs at a faster pace than anyone in the history of cricket. Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his chances against them much more.",
            "As a starry-eyed youngster from Najafgarh, where his family ran a flour mill, Sehwag grew up, like many others from his generation, wanting to be Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, when he scored his first one-day hundred, filling up for his injured idol against New Zealand in Sri Lanka, he could have been mistaken for him: there was the same back-foot punch on the off side, the minimalistic straight drive and the wristy whip to the leg. And on his Test debut, on a fiery pitch in Bloemfontein, he matched the master stroke for stroke as they both blazed away to hundreds. But soon he emerged his own man, and not long after Tendulkar was playing a supporting, and somewhat calming, hand as Sehwag romped away to a triple-hundred, the first by an Indian, in Multan, bringing it up with a six. Two Tests ago, he had been dismissed trying the same stroke five short of what would have been his first Test double-hundred.",
            "His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as quickly as possible - belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his own, and his opponents', strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What appears risky to many, is merely an opportunity for him, and his lack of footwork, which does get him in trouble against the moving ball, is mostly an advantage, for it creates space for his brilliant handwork. Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square on the off side, and fewer still have hit them as frequently. And the sight of a spinner brings the savage out in him: and for many spectacular assaults against the world's leading spinners, there have numerous outrageous dismissals against the not-so-reputed ones.",
            "The most remarkable aspect of Sehwag's career of course has been his ability to build massive scores at breathtaking speed. He holds the Indian record for highest number of Test double-hundreds, and came within seven runs of becoming the first batsman to score three triple-hundreds. That innings, against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, epitomised the Sehwag brand of batsmanship: a mix of imagination, daring, power, skills, and clarity of vision. His ODI career doesn't have as many high points, and yet he held the record for the highest score in that format at one point, scoring an astonishing 219 against West Indies in Indore. The most remarkable feature of the innings was the ease with which he reached the landmark, completing his double-hundred with more than six overs to spare.  "

            "Early in his career Abdul Razzaq was expected to become Pakistan's most complete allrounder since Imran Khan, but although he didn't quite get there, he was a more than dependable player across formats. He was once rapid enough to open the bowling and was always composed enough to bat anywhere in the order, though it was lower down that suited him best. ",
            "His bowling - the reason he was first noticed - was characterised by a galloping approach, accuracy and reverse swing. But it was his batting that was more likely to win matches. He boasted a prodigious array of strokes and was particularly strong driving through cover and mid-off off both feet. ",
            "Razzaq had two gears: block or blast. Cut off the big shots and he would get bogged down, although patience was his virtue as he demonstrated in a match-saving fifty against India in Mohali in 2005. Just prior to that he had also played a bewilderingly slow innings in Australia, scoring four runs in over two hours. When the occasion demanded it, though, he could slog with the best of them: England were pillaged for a 22-ball 51 at the end of 2005 and then taken for nearly 60 runs in the last three overs of an ODI in September the following year.",
            "It wasn't smooth sailing through Razzaq's career. He suffered a slump, particularly in his bowling, between 2002 and 2004, when, though his place in the team wasn't under threat, there was uncertainty over how best to use him. But if the pitch was in any way helpful to seam - as it was in his first and only Test five-wicket haul in Karachi in 2004, or against India at the same venue in January 2006 - he could be a proper danger. Though Kamran Akmal's hundred overshadowed all in the 2006 Karachi win over India, Razzaq's performance in that game was easily his most emphatic as an allrounder: he scored 45 and 90 and took seven wickets. ",
            "A combination of injuries and poor form put his Test place into question and a knee injury days before the 2007 World Cup meant Pakistan missed his presence in a disastrous campaign. A lacklustre comeback saw Razzaq being omitted from the 2007 T20 World Cup and he subsequently announced his retirement from international cricket. He went on to sign for Worcestershire as well as for the Indian Cricket League, which ruled him out of Pakistan contention. He took back his decision to retire but committed himself to the ICL for two seasons, during which he served Hyderabad Heroes as one of their star players. ",
            "After a global amnesty for ICL players, Razzaq was welcomed back to the Pakistan fold for the 2009 T20 World Cup in England and made an immediate impact as Pakistan won the tournament. He played the 2011 50-over World Cup as well, but didn't have a significant impact in it.\n"

            "The quintessential country boy, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza epitomised the term \"bursting onto the scene\". He first came into attention during an under-17 regional tournament in 2001 when he bowled fast, slammed sixes and dived around without a care in the world.",
            "Mashrafe's entry also sparked plenty of enthusiasm because he was the first genuine fast bowler to emerge from Bangladesh since their entry into Test cricket in 2000. He was sent to a camp conducted by West Indian great Andy Roberts, who proclaimed that Mashrafe had a great future. The selectors fast-tracked his growth and within a few months, during which he played four games for Bangladesh A in India, the young man from far-off Narail took the new-ball against visiting Zimbabwe. Soon it was clear that he had what it takes: Mashrafe was making the likes of Grant Flower jump around due to his pace, a first for a Bangladeshi fast bowler.",
            "But another thing was also clear to those who observed him - his rickety bowling action. Feet and arms landed in the wrong arcs, and soon the injuries set in. And that has been the story of his career. Mashrafe has missed more games for Bangladesh than he has played ever since his 2001 debut. He has had seven operations on his legs, knees and ankles, which have taking a beating - first due to poor handling by captains who gave him long and ill-adviced bowling spells, and then due to freakish accidents.",
            "After many missed games in between the odd fiery spell, Mashrafe rose to prominence in 2004, when he helped Bangladesh beat India for the first time. He was ever-present when Bangladesh pushed Australia but dropped the crucial catch of Ricky Ponting that cost the home side a win. But he made up the following year when his four-wicket haul destroyed India in the 2007 World Cup game at Port-of-Spain. Mashrafe's early strikes have always helped Bangladesh, none more so than in the 2009 tri-series final when he and Nazmul Hossain sunk Sri Lanka to a new low - six runs for five wickets. Bangladesh lost the game but Mashrafe was tremendous in his ten overs."

            "A top-order batter for Mumbai, Rahane scored over 1000 runs in his second Ranji season, helping the side secure their 38th title win. He made his Test debut in 2013, after months of travelling with the squad, and then in his third match, he scored 51 not out and 96 in Durban. His first Test century followed soon, in a draw in Wellington in February 2014. Five months later, he was in the vanguard for India's first win at Lord's in nearly three decades, setting the game up with a solid 103 in the first innings. He followed it up with his maiden ODI century, at Edgbaston, as India wrapped up the ODI series 3-1.",
            "Rahane's impressive form continued, with hundreds in Melbourne and Colombo, and then two against South Africa in the 2015-16 Delhi Test, in a series where no one else scored a century. His partnership with Cheteshwar Pujara against Australia in the 2017 Bengaluru Test helped India level the series, which they went on to win two Tests later under Rahane's captaincy. ",
            "Early in 2018, he produced a match-turning second-innings knock on a tough Johannesburg pitch, after having been dropped for the first two matches of the series, but he was no longer looking like the dominating Test batter he had previously been.",
            "Even so, his most significant Test innings was yet to come. When India were bowled out for 36 in Adelaide in December 2020, he took charge of an under-pressure team for the rest of the series (regular captain Virat Kohli left the tour for the birth of his child). In the next Test, in Melbourne, Rahane produced a masterclass hundred that set the tone for India's hard-fought series win. ",
            "He was dropped again in 2022, but made a comeback in the 2023 World Test Championship final, where he top-scored for India, but they lost the title to Australia.",
            "Although known for his orthodox batting, Rahane has had success as a T20 batter as well. He scored over 500 runs in two IPL seasons for Rajasthan Royals, has two hundreds in the tournament, led Mumbai to the Syed Mushtaq Ali title in 2022-23, and astonished everyone with a belligerent 61 off 27 balls for Chennai Super Kings against Mumbai Indians in the 2023 IPL.\n"

His first stint in the IPL was in 2012, when he was part of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad but did not play a game for them.",
            "- At the age of 19, Samson won the best young player of the season award in 2013, for scoring 206 runs and taking 13 catches. He has scored three IPL centuries to date.",
            "- An attacking top-order batter and wicketkeeper, Samson led Royals to the IPL final in 2022, where they came runners-up to Gujarat Titans",
            "Sanju Samson was perhaps the first top-drawer Indian player to be known primarily for his feats for his IPL franchise than for the national side. A Rajasthan Royals mainstay, he has made over 3000 runs for them in the course of his first eight seasons.",
            "Samson moved to Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala in his early teens after taking his first cricket lessons in Delhi, where his father worked as a police constable. In Kerala, he created waves on the junior circuit with his batting, showing impressive technique and an ability to time the ball crisply. He made it to the India side for the Under-19 Asia Cup in 2011 but did not impress in the tournament, and missed out on selection for India's U-19 World Cup side the following year. ",
            "Rajasthan Royals bought Samson at the IPL auction in 2013, when he was 18, and save for the two years when the side was out of the league for a ban, he has been a fixture in their line-up. He was appointed captain in 2021, when he made 484 runs, kicking off with a barnstorming 119 off 63 balls in their tournament opener, against Punjab Kings, followed by three 40s in a row later in the season, and then an unbeaten 70 and 82 in back-to-back games. His fine, consistent displays did not reflect in Royals' finishes on the tournament's points table, which continued to be disappointing up until 2022, when they were second (Samson made 458 runs that year).",
            "He made his first-class debut in 2011-12, and impressed with bat and as keeper for Kerala in the Ranji Trophy. In 2013-14 he finished with 530 runs at an average of just under 60, including a double-hundred in his first game; that was followed by 475 runs the next season. In 2015-16, he was 20 when he was appointed captain of the Kerala side. In October 2019, in a showcase of his by then formidable white-ball skills, Samson made 212 not out, the highest score in the history of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the time, for Kerala against Goa.",
            "A call-up to the India T20 side came in July 2015, and he made his debut against Zimbabwe in Harare, but then went four and a half years before his next game in the format for India. He made his ODI debut in 2021, which was followed a gap again, of a year before he played his next ODI - in a series in the West Indies, where he made 54 in the second match.\n"

As a lower-middle-order batsman, Nasir can bat in different gears depending on the match situation; as an offspinner he has control and accuracy; and his fielding is perhaps the most exciting part of his game. His potential was seen in his first international game, when he scored 63 against Zimbabwe, the highest by a Bangladeshi on ODI debut. That performance led to his Test debut against West Indies in October 2011, a month before his 20th birthday.",
            "That he had a feel for sports was obvious pretty early in Nasir's life: he joined Bangladesh's only sports institute, BKSP, in 2004 as a 13-year-old. In a few years, Nasir quickly became an important member of the institute's league team and played a key role in its promotion to the Premier League. At the same time, he represented the Bangladesh Under-19 side in the 2008 World Cup when he was 16.",
            "His move to Abahani, one of the biggest clubs in the country, was a move fraught with risk but Nasir held his nerve in tight games and soon became a regular for them. In one of his early games, his courage to open the bowling against Sanath Jayasuriya (who was playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club) was seen as a mark of his promise."

He made his international debut in early 2008, in the home ODI series against Zimbabwe, and though he did reasonably well in his early games, he was dropped in 2009 and spent two-and-a-half years away from international cricket. He returned with his appetite suitably whetted, and 2012 was a particularly memorable year for him, as he scored two ODI hundreds against India, and followed up with one more early the next year to firmly establish himself at the top of the order. An aggressive batsman, Jamshed plays strokes all round the wicket, but also backs it up with sound temperament and an ability to convert starts into big scores.",
            "Jamshed's talent was visible from his junior days, and he made a mark very early in his cricketing career. Following an impressive 74 for National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) on his first-class debut when aged only 15, Nasir Jamshed was selected for the Pakistan Under-19s side to play the visiting Sri Lankans. Scoring a 44 and a 204 on his debut, he helped his side draw that match after Pakistan had conceded a 253-run first-innings lead. Although he failed to replicate those performances for the remainder of the season, he remained part of the NBP squad as well as representing Lahore. Jamshed was also part of the Pakistan U-19 squad that successfully defended its title in 2006, beating India by 38 runs."

            "His first international incarnation came for Australia in the West Indies in 2008 when he stood in creditably for the injured Brad Haddin in four ODIs and a T20: his glovework was brilliant and in St Kitts in the last of those ODIs he clubbed a 22-ball half-century. But his form fell away the following domestic summer and he added only two more T20 internationals to his tally for Australia. ",
            "For a while after, Ronchi was there and thereabouts in state cricket for Western Australia, for whom he had played for about a decade at that point, having established himself as a solid keeper and clean striker of the ball. In 2007 he made a 56-ball hundred for them, then the fastest in Australian domestic one-day history. Also that season, in a first-class game against Queensland, he lashed a belligerent 51-ball hundred where the second fifty came off 11 balls.",
            "Ronchi was overtaken around the turn of the decade by other keepers, among them Tim Paine and Matthew Wade, in the queue to succeed Haddin, and at the end of 2011-12, he decided to try his luck in New Zealand, securing a contract with Wellington. Once he qualified for national representation, he earned a call-up to the ODI side in 2013, and debuted against England in an ODI in May, becoming the first man since Kepler Wessels nearly 20 years earlier to represent two ICC Full-Member nations.",
            "As New Zealand rode an ODI wave that eventually culminated in defeat in the final of the 2015 World Cup, Ronchi made a decent case for himself as a lower-order batter. He made 79 and 99 from No. 7 in back-to-back defeats against South Africa in Mount Maunganui in 2014, and smashed 170 not out off 99 balls in a big win against Sri Lanka in Dunedin early in 2015. ",
            "In May that year, seven years into his international career, Ronchi played his first Test, against England in Leeds, making 88 and 31 in a win in Headingley. He played three more Tests, all in India in 2016 (he made 80 in Kanpur), two T20 World Cups and two Champions Trophies before calling time on his international career in June 2017. "

",

Still, it was a taste of what Henriques seemed destined for ever since he captained Australia's Under-19 side in the 2006 World Cup. A hulking allrounder and natural leader, Henriques first captained New South Wales at the age of 22. He had been around the squad for many years already; when he first joined the Blues he was so young he could train only in school holidays and often had to catch a taxi to practice. ",

His career was disrupted by injury, none more disturbing than when his  2015 season with Surrey. He made just three appearances before colliding with team-mate Rory Burns and suffering a fractured jaw. He returned two years later without further mishap."

Following Michael Vaughan's return home due to injury early in the tour, Shah was drafted in as a replacement and made a composed and vital 88 in a memorable victory. A stylish and classical batsman who seemed to have the world at his feet as a teenager, he was compared in ability to the young Mark Ramprakash. Shah made his first-class debut in 1996, and at the end of the promising summer, Wisden praised his \"abundant promise\". His county cap followed, but back-to-back seasons with averages in the mid 20s ended with him being dropped by Middlesex in 2000. ",
            "He bounced back in 2001 in fine form, and was drafted into England's one-day side in the NatWest Series where he looked at ease, especially when making 62 against Pakistan at Lord's. Even though he toured as part of England's one-day squad to Zimbabwe and New Zealand that winter, his chances were limited. He was overlooked in 2002, but again played a few one-dayers the following winter in the ICC Knock-out Trophy and in the VB Series, but he found it almost impossible to forge a place in the side.  Another solid season followed, but others edged ahead of him in the pecking order, and there was talk that his fielding was not helping his cause. His international ambitions suffered a further blow when he was relieved of the vice-captaincy at Middlesex in June 2004 after a string of bad results. However, a feast of runs in 2005 (1728 runs at a healthy average of 66.46) led to his inclusion in the England A tour of the Caribbean in 2006, and ultimately his Test debut. Further opportunities were thin on the ground, however. He had to wait 18 months for his second Test - another one-off appearance, this time at Lord's against West Indies where he failed twice - but a series of eyecatching performances followed in the one-day series, as England rebuilt after another disappointing World Cup campaign. Despite the continued failings of England's top 6, he was but a spectator and drinks carrier for the Test tours of Sri Lanka and New Zealand.",
            "Good county form and half-centuries in the home ODIs against New Zealand ensured he travelled to India at the end of 2008, and he finally got his opportunity in the Caribbean the following spring, following the selectors' temporary loss of patience with Ian Bell. An anxious Shah failed to cement his position, however, with his uncertain running-between-the-wickets proving his downfall, and he was overlooked for the subsequent home summer as Ravi Bopara leapt into the No. 3 position."

            "When Chanderpaul started out, he had a couple of problems: first, a low conversion rate of around one hundred to every ten fifties, and secondly, his physical frailty, widely thought to be hypochondria. That myth was exploded when a large piece of floating bone was removed from his foot late in 2000, and, suitably liberated, he set about rectifying his hundreds problem, scoring three in four Tests against India in 2001-02, and two more in the home series against Australia the following year, including 104 as West Indies successfully chased a world-record 418 for victory in the final Test in Antigua. ",
            "Since then, he managed to keep his own standards at a remarkably high level despite the perennial problems that West Indies faced. On the few occasions that West Indies tasted success during his career, Chanderpaul's contributions were vital - in the Champions Trophy triumph in 2004, he contributed greatly with a consistent performances. ",
            "A stint as West Indies captain followed in 2005-06, and though he celebrated with a double-century in front of his home fans in Guyana, it was clear that captaincy was affecting his batting, and in 2006 he gave it up to concentrate on his main job. "

            "Andrew Symonds brought gusto to whatever he did, whether firing down offbreaks or mediums, hurling his ungainly bulk round the field or vigorously ruffling the bowler's hair at the celebration of a wicket. He saved his loudest grunt for his batting, where he was that rarest of modern-day creatures - an unabashed six-hitter in the mould of a George Bonnor or a Colin Milburn or a David Hookes. Batting for Gloucestershire at 20, he scythed 16 sixes in the first dig [a world record] against Glamorgan at Abergavenny, 20 for the match [another first], and then announced he couldn't care less about the milestone; he wanted only to help his team. His flaw was to attempt one six too many - invariably off the wrong ball - and get mixed up in off-field troubles. ",
            "\"I used to hate watching him bat,\" his old coach Toot Byron once lamented. \"He wasn't in control of his shot-selection ... he'd get 24 off an over and then go out on the last ball of that over.\" Legend has it that Symonds, a Queensland larrikin who shaved his dreadlocks early in 2009, once turned up barefoot and wearing a cowboy hat for a contract meeting with Cricket Australia's then-chief executive Malcolm Speed. He also ruled himself ineligible for any award at the 2006 Allan Border Medal - he would have been the One-Day Player of the Year - after being suspended for turning up drunk before Australia's embarrassing loss to Bangladesh on the 2005 Ashes tour. ",
            "During almost five years in and out of the one-day side he frittered away golden opportunities galore. One day changed everything. Striding out with his team in turmoil against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup, a game and tournament he never expected to play in, Symonds sculpted a masterly 143 not out in 125 balls. Until that day, he had mustered just 762 one-day runs at only 23; after that he averaged more than 43 and became a hero to those who adored his clumping style. \"In the past,\" he admitted, \"I was a man without a map when I went out to bat.\" He grew to understand his one-day role perfectly - he could have claimed to be the side's most valuable player after pounding three hundreds and taking 21 wickets in 2005-06. His impact to the limited-overs outfit was shown the following season after he ripped a tendon from his arm playing a fierce drive. Without him the team struggled to its worst losing streak in a decade. Symonds proved he was an incredibly quick healer by entering the World Cup mid-tournament and was part of his second consecutive triumph. ",
            "Born in Birmingham, Symonds could have played for England but dreamed only of wearing the baggy green. In 2004 his fantasy was fulfilled in decidedly unGabbalike surroundings: the crackling minefields of Sri Lanka. He batted gamely without looking altogether comfortable, and was dumped after two Tests. Almost two years later he received an extended run as Australia's selectors searched for an answer to Andrew Flintoff, but he couldn't consistently mirror his one-day performances. Faced with the axe, he cracked a huge six at the MCG to open his scoring in a pressure-relieving 72 from 54 balls, which included a ground-record five maximums, but was dropped on the Bangladesh tour after struggling for reliable impact in the previous series against South Africa. Given another opportunity when Shane Watson was injured and Damien Martyn retired, he appeared in his first Ashes series and reached a career high in his second game with 156 at the MCG. Batting with his fishing friend Matthew Hayden, he showed he had the mindset to make it. ",
            "The 2007-08 campaign was easily his best, with 777 runs in nine Tests against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies. The high was an unbeaten 162 in the first innings at the SCG, which was quickly followed by the low of a lengthy race row involving Harbhajan Singh. The problems did not prevent him becoming the most popular overseas player at the Indian Premier League auction, where he sold for US$1.35m, and he had four games with the Deccan Chargers. After the tournament he switched back into five-day mode and a pair of half-centuries in the tight opening contest with West Indies showed his growing batting maturity and sense of security at Test level. By the end of the campaign his average was a respectable 44.65. "

            "A hard-hitting opener and an archetype of the successful Twenty20 batsman, Loots Bosman was born in Kimberley in the Cape Province, where he was raised by his grandfather, and made his debut for Griqualand West at the beginning of the 1997-98 season. But despite some success with provincial and South Africa A sides, it was only when Twenty20 cricket arrived in South Africa that Bosman etched his name into his country's cricketing consciousness. Pro20 cricket's first outing came at the end of the 2003-04 season, and Bosman - who was now part of the Eagles team under the new franchise system - topped the batting charts with 219 runs at a strike-rate of 120.99 and a high score of 84* despite the fact that he was asked to bat in the middle order.  ",
            "Bosman was a key figure in South Africa A's campaign in a triangular one-day tournament in Sri Lanka in 2005-06, but it was his exploits at home that earned him a call-up to the squad for the Twenty20 International against Australia in mid-February. His 22-ball fifty against the Highveld Lions in February was the fastest in the Standard Bank Pro20 series. Player of the Series in the 2006 edition, Bosman became the first batsman to score a century in the competition, reaching three figures in just 43 balls. He failed to get going in the 2007 final, but his contributions to the Eagles clinching the Pro20 title were enough to earn him a look-in for the national Twenty20 side. He missed the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 due to a back injury, though Bosman insisted at the time that he was fit to play and he was subsequently suspended for one domestic match after being found guilty of \"unbecoming or detrimental\" conduct by Cricket South Africa over comments made to a local newspaper about coach Mickey Arthur after he was left out of the squad. ",
            "Bosman turned down a contract with the Indian Cricket League in October 2007, instead signing up for the Mumbai Indians in the first edition of the Indian Premier League, though he couldn't make it into a starting XI. Bosman had a quiet international year in 2008, playing just one Twenty20 against Bangladesh, and at the end of the 2008-09 domestic season moved from the Eagles to the Dolphins franchise in KwaZulu-Natal. Initially named in a provisional squad of 30 for the 2009 World Twenty20, he couldn't find a place in the final 15, but in November of that year he fell one blow short of what would have been, at the time, just the second international Twenty20 century. Smashing 94 from just 45 balls, including nine sixes, against England at Centurion, he was also involved in a world record 170-run opening stand with Graeme Smith as South Africa racked up a mammoth 241 for 6. ",
            "Bosman finally made it to a World Twenty20 tournament in the Caribbean in 2010, but appeared strangely out of sorts and made just eight runs in two innings, failing to find the boundary once. Despite that failure, he was signed by Derbyshire as their overseas player for the Friends Provident t20 tournament in 2010, and responded in superb fashion, hammering 94 off 50 balls to set up a crushing 65-run win over a strong Yorkshire side in June.

            "Ben Duckett, an exciting but untamed talent, produced what promised to be a transformative season in 2016, culminating in a call up for England's winter tours of Bangladesh and India. Career-best performances in all three formats - including the sixth-highest first-class score for Northamptonshire, a one-day double-hundred for the Lions, and a starring role on NatWest Blast Finals Day - pushed him into contention even before the withdrawals of Eoin Morgan and Alex Hales from the trip to Bangladesh made his selection inevitable.",
            "In July of 2016, Duckett scored 650 List A runs at an average of 130.00, a run which included scores of 163 not out and 220 not out, the latter a record, for England Lions. He had begun the season by scoring 282 not out in the Championship against Sussex - it could have been bigger were it not for the washout of the last two days - and he went on to gain further plaudits with a thrilling 84 in the Blast semi-final as Northamptonshire again claimed the trophy. He scored 2,706 runs in all formats - the highest tally since Marcus Trescothick's 2,934 in 2009. As Wisden remarked in making him a Cricketer of the Year: \"He batted with panache, impish ingenuity, confidence and courage - all before turning 22.\"",
            "He started strongly in Bangladesh, as he struck two half-centuries as England beat Bangladesh 2-1 in the one-day series, but his first England winter turned sour after a technical glitch was mercilessly targeted by the India spinner Ravi Ashwin, who exploited a tendency to sit back in the crease on leg stump and play with half a bat away from his pads. He was dropped two Tests into the 4-0 series defeat - his last innings, a 16-ball duck in Visakapatnam as he reluctantly followed Alastair Cook's orders for the team to drop anchor on the final day - and England concluded he needed to mature further on the county circuit. He had a modest season until taking out his frustration on Sussex in September with 1983 from 200 balls.",
            "But the perception that Duckett was something of a loose cannon was unavoidable after he intruded into the narrative of England's 2017-18 Ashes tour in less-than-helpful fashion. Duckett, touring with England Lions, found himself headline news when he throw beer over James Anderson, England's record-breaking Test bowler, in a Perth bar. With England riding out exaggerated allegations of a drinks culture at the time, it was as dim-witted as it was inconsequential. Duckett was fined and suspended from the rest of the tour and would need to rebuild trust before England took another look.",
            "Those who imagined that Duckett would roar defiance with a stack of runs in 2018 were disappointed. His Northants captain Alex Wakely had depicted him as a well-meaning if naïve individual, and suggested he had been a scapegoat for England's failings, but such a shrewd assessment brought no return in runs. Duckett averaged 25 in the Championship, took pleasure in a T20-best of 96 against Leicestershire and then departed for Nottinghamshire before the end of the summer. At 23, he still had time in his favour.",
            "The lowlight of a lean first year at Trent Bridge was the T20 Blast semi-final against Worcestershire, in which Duckett ended 49 not out in a dramatic one-run loss. Following a middle-order collapse, Duckett needed only a single from Wayne Parnell's last ball to level the scores and send them through on wickets lost, but sunk to his haunches after playing and missing. During the Covid-19 lockdown at the start of the 2020 season, Duckett decided it was time to shed some weight, and looked like a different man when called up to England's white-ball bubble early in the season. He did not ultimately win a place in the side, but made two Bob Willis Trophy hundreds and struck the winning runs on Finals Day as a further reminder of his ability.",
            "Duckett, a wicketkeeper-batsman and product of Stowe School, quickly made strides at Northants where he had been part of the youth set-up since 11 years old.  He made his first-team debut at 17 and soon made a maiden fifty against Leicestershire. He then received an unexpected summons to the Northants side as they won the Twenty20 trophy against Surrey at Edgbaston because of an injury sustained by Kyle Coetzer in the semi-final earlier in the day. A few months later, he was dropped by England Under-19s for failing a fitness test and admitted that \"complacency\" had crept in. His success in the World Cup was proof of his positive response.",
            "Yet his Under-19 record was a good one. Many England cricketers have passed through the Under-19 side, such is the level of age-group planning, but few can boast the Under-19 World Cup batting average achieved by Duckett. He is one of two players - the England captain Alastair Cook being the other - to have averaged more than 60 in the tournament. He also collected Man-of-the-Match awards with 61 against India in the quarter-final and a century as England beat Australia by one-wicket in the third-place play-off.",
            "His commitment was further questioned, though, when he was omitted from Northants' pre-season tour of Barbados in 2015 as his fitness levels again fell below expected standards. He was chastened that summer by a drink-driving ban (having driven his car off a road a year earlier), but responded in the next week by helping Northants through to the quarter-final of the NatWest Blast.",
            "He scored heavily in the Championship, too, after Northants' coach David Ripley asked him to open the batting - quite a gamble considering his reputation as an indisciplined middle-order dasher. It began an eye-catching run of form which brought four Championship hundreds in his last eight innings of 2015. \"I'm not the most focused person, and can lose concentration in quite a lot of things,\" he said. \"But, right now, scoring runs is the most important thing in life.\" England needed him to hold the thought for the next decade.\n"

That performance propelled him into Sri Lanka's Under-19 squad, where he again impressed, making 265 runs at an average of 44.17 in the 2014 Youth World Cup. ",
            "While Kusal Mendis - his team-mate from that U-19 side - was fast-tracked to the national side, Samarawickrama would have to earn his place through first-class performances. His first season with Colts Cricket Club was modest, but his second was good, and his third outstanding. Samarawickrama topped Tier-A run charts with 1016 runs at 59.76 in the 2016-17 season. On his debut for Sri Lanka A in February 2017, he cracked 185 runs off 223 balls against a strong England Lions attack. "

            "Strength was Matthew Hayden's strength - both mental and physical. It enabled him to shrug off years of carping that he was technically too limited for Test cricket because of the way he played around his front pad, and it enabled him to touch rarefied heights of batsmanship. Before his maiden first-class innings, he asked if anyone had made 200 on debut, then went out and hit 149. The runs rarely abated over the next 17 years. Tall, powerful and equipped with concentration befitting the fisherman and surfer that he is, he battered the ball at and through the off side for days at a time. He has also made himself a fine catcher in the slips and gully. ",
            "Hayden's earliest Tests were exclusively against South Africa and West Indies, a trial for any opener. They were not auspicious, but patience and willpower won the day, especially after the tour of India in 2000-01, where he slog-swept his way to 549 runs, an Australian record for a three-Test series. By the end of 2001 he had broken Bob Simpson's Australian mark for most Test runs in a calendar year - Ricky Ponting first topped Hayden's 1391 in 2003 - and formed a prodigiously prolific opening partnership with Justin Langer. Belatedly he came good in the one-day arena too, and by the time the 2003 World Cup rolled around he was ranked among the top three batsmen in both forms of the game. Later that year he hammered 380 against Zimbabwe at Perth, briefly borrowing the Test record from Brian Lara, and in mid-2004 he was at it again, battering Sri Lanka for twin centuries that took his tally to 20 in only 55 Tests. ",
            "Weary through years of plunder and a difficult India tour, Hayden experienced an extended slump during 2004-05 and was initially replaced as one-day opener by Michael Clarke. His lack of form and footwork continued against England and his disastrous series only improved at The Oval with 138. It was the awkward beginning of a resurgence that extended his career and thrust him towards more middle-aged domination. Usually playing more patiently, he followed his south London renaissance with three hundreds in successive matches, becoming the third player next to Bradman and Barrington to score four in a row twice, and passed 1000 runs in a calendar year for the fifth time. After reaching three figures on five occasions during 2005-06 and adding 153 at the MCG a year later, he stood behind only Bradman, Ponting and Waugh on Australia's list of century-makers. With three hundreds in consecutive games against India in 2007-08, he quickly leapfrogged Bradman's 29, and had 30 when he waved goodbye.",
            "Regaining the Ashes in 2006-07 brought tears to Hayden's eyes and he was also saddened when Langer retired at the end of the series, although his mood lifted when he won back his one-day place. In the final match of the 2006-07 Chappell-Hadlee series he thumped an Australian-record 181 off 166 balls, which included ten sixes, and showed his impressive power. More muscle was on display at the World Cup as he averaged 73.22 in scoring 659 runs, the most at the tournament, and he later revealed he was carrying a fractured toe and a broken bone in his other foot. A frightening 66-ball century against South Africa earned him honorary St Kitts citizenship and the outdoors man completed a dream trip by scoring another two hundreds, hooking a 136kg marlin and winning the World Cup for a second time.

            "Tim Southee, a right-arm swing bowler, burst upon the international scene in great style. He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes.",
            "It was a debut that gave a clear indication of the career to come. Over the next decade or so, Southee would go on to form one of the world's best new-ball partnerships with Trent Boult, and would also come to be known for his ability to clear the fence. He hit his 50th six in only his 36th Test.",
            "In 2022 he was named as New Zealand's Test captain when Kane Williamson stood down from the role.",
            "Pace and outswing are the main tools of Southee's trade. His bag of 18 wickets at 17.33 in the 2011 World Cup prompted Allan Donald to say he had the potential to become the best swing bowler in the world, and though frequent injury-forced absences have kept him from fulfilling that prophecy, he has shown he can be devastating across a wide range of conditions.",
            "In 2012, he showed his adaptability in the subcontinent, picking up 7 for 64 in Bangalore, the best figures for a New Zealand bowler in India, before bowling his side to a rare win in Sri Lanka with match figures of 8 for 120 at the P Sara Oval. Two years later, his 11 wickets in the West Indies, at 21.09, helped New Zealand achieve their first series win away from home, against anyone other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe, in 12 years. In ODIs, his landmark performance came at the 2015 World Cup, when he sliced through England's batting with a sensational spell of swing bowling to finish with figures of 7 for 33, the best bowling figures for a New Zealander in ODIs."

On his first tour, to England in 2000, Sarwan lived up to the hype by topping the averages. His footwork, which seemed to require no early trigger movements, was strikingly confident and precise.",
            "Then came a horror run of three runs in five innings in Australia, but he recovered against South Africa, and against India in 2001-02 he made four fifties in eight Test innings. Still, Sarwan, who took over as West Indies vice-captain to Brian Lara in March 2003, needed 49 innings to post his maiden Test century - 119 in December 2002, against Bangladesh. ",
            "A dream away series against South Africa in 2003-04, where he made two hundreds, was followed by a lean run against England, but he returned to form with an unbeaten 261, against Bangladesh again. West Indies shone in their one-dayers in England in 2004, reaching the final of the NatWest Series, and then winning the ICC Champions Trophy, with Sarwan playing a big hand in both tournaments. ",
            "He was one of the players involved in a contract dispute with the WICB and missed the first Test against South Africa in 2005. On his return he scored attractive runs but was again overlooked for the captaincy, which was handed back to Lara. It finally came Sarwan's way following Lara's retirement in 2007, but he was out of the side injured from mid-2007 for about a year, and he was Chris Gayle's deputy on his return to the side for the home series against Sri Lanka - in which he made three half-centuries and a hundred in the two Tests.",
            "In the 2009 home series against England, Sarwan recorded his personal best of 291 in the fourth Test. He made his 15th, and last, Test century against England at Chester-le-Street in May the same year, in a series West Indies lost 2-0. ",
            "Sarwan lost his central contract in 2010 and subsequently won damages from the West Indies board over comments made about his attitude and fitness. He played his last Test against India in Bridgetown in June 2011, finishing ten runs short of the career average Dexter predicted. He was recalled for the first time in 18 months in early 2013, for the ODI side, did poorly against Australia, and made an unbeaten 120 against Zimbabwe. Three matches on, his international career was over."

            "Chris Lynn was one of the first Australian players in his prime to turn his back on first-class cricket to become a white-ball specialist. It did not hinder his selection for Australia at T20I and ODI level but his inconsistency at international level saw him miss out on the 2019 World Cup after being seen as a potential asset for the previous 18 months. In 2018-19, he became the BBL's all-time leading run scorer and took over from Brendon McCullum as captain of the Brisbane Heat. ",
            "A prolific scorer when fully fit, Lynn had his run-marking severely curtailed in 2014-15 and 2015-16, suffering serious shoulder injuries in both years. In 2014 he had surgery on his left shoulder to fix a rotator cuff problem and missed the entire Matador Cup and the first half of the Sheffield Shield season. In 2015 a near identical scenario befell him when he injured his left shoulder during a fielding drill and missed the Matador Cup - in which he was to captain Queensland - and the first half of the Shield summer. The timing was unfortunate for Lynn, who in 2014 had made his T20 debut for Australia and missed opportunities to strengthen his international credentials. Still, when he was fit he was he scored heavily, including a 250 against eventual champions Victoria during the 2014-15 Sheffield Shield, and as the BBL's leading run scorer in 2015-16 with 378 at 54.00 and a strike-rate of 173."

Ten days later he hit a maiden international hundred in an ODI to take Sri Lanka to victory in Adelaide. "

A year later he was playing ODI cricket and a year after that he played in the 2007 World Cup as a 17-year-old, one of only five players to have appeared in the tournament at such a young age. Worcestershire were delighted to sign him and quietly thought of him as a long-term replacement for Graeme Hick.",

",
            "He retired from international cricket in 2013 with a view to concentrating on his county form - a decision described as \"extremely disappointing\" by Netherlands officials - and enjoyed an improved 2014 season when he was the county's second highest run-scorer in a Championship campaign that helped them gain promotion.",
            "But 2015 was disappointing. Over taken in the battle for a first-team place by younger men, he played just four Championship games and did not feature in any of the white ball games; for such a talented player, his limited-overs form - in domestic T20 in particular - is oddly modest. He finished the season working hard on his off-spin in the hope of forcing his way back into contention as an allrounder."

Coming in at No. 11, with Australia reeling at 117 for 9, he struck an astonishing 98 - the highest Test score ever by a No. 11 - playing strokes that top-order batters would be proud of. He then picked up Alastair Cook as his maiden victim, thus becoming the first teenaged Australian spinner to take a Test wicket.",

Against South Africa in Johannesburg that year, he took 5 for 24, then the best figures for Australia in T20Is, which included a hat-trick, and a year later, bettered it with 6 for 30 against New Zealand in Wellington."

            "Going in first or seventh, wearing whites or coloureds, Adam Gilchrist was the symbolic heart of 2000s Australia's steamrolling agenda and the most exhilarating cricketer of the modern age. He was simultaneously a cheerful throwback to more innocent times, a flap-eared country boy who walked when given not out in a World Cup semi-final, and one who swatted his second ball for six while sitting on a Test pair. ",
            "\"Just hit the ball,\" is how he once described his philosophy on batting, and he seldom strayed from it. Employing a high-on-the-handle grip, Gilchrist poked good balls into gaps and throttled most others, invariably with head straight, wrists soft and balance sublime. Only at the death did he jettison the textbook, whirling his bat like a hammer-thrower. Still he managed to score at a tempo - 81 per 100 balls in Tests, 96 in ODIs - that made Viv Richards and Gilbert Jessop look like sticks in the-mud. ",
            "Indeed it was arguably Gilchrist's belated Test arrival that turned Australia from powerful to overpowering. He bludgeoned 81 on debut, pouched five catches and made a stumping, and barely paused for breath until he stepped down in 2008. Only in the closing stages of an untouchable career did his appetite slow - he was troubled by Andrew Flintoff's around-the-wicket angle in 2005 and found the flaw difficult to overcome - and his match-turning 144 against Bangladesh in April 2006 was his first century in 16 Tests. ",
            "The 2006-07 Ashes series was literally hit and miss for Gilchrist, with three single-figure scores, two fifties, and his most brutal hundred. At home his one-day form was subdued, but the game's biggest competition - and it's most important match - brought out his highest standards. He stole the 2007 World Cup final from Sri Lanka with 149 off 104 balls, slamming 13 fours and eight sixes, and added to his 54 and 57 from his previous two finals. Using a tip - advice that should have been patented instantly - from his batting coach Bob Meuleman, he put a squash ball in his glove to allow him to hit straighter in that 2007 game. ",
            "In Tests, three Gilchrist innings rank among the most amazing by Australians: his death-defying unbeaten 149 against Pakistan in Hobart in 1999 when all seemed lost, his savage and emotional 204 not out against South Africa in Johannesburg two years on, and his 57-delivery Ashes century in Perth. His 472 dismissals in ODIs are the most by an Australian keeper. ",
            "Standing in for Ricky Ponting as captain, Gilchrist crossed the final frontier, leading Australia to their first series win in India for 35 years in 2004-05. As a wicketkeeper he lacked Rod Marsh's acrobatics and Ian Healy's finesse, but if he clutched few screamers, he dropped even fewer sitters, although one easy offering in Adelaide in 2008 convinced him it was time to go. During that match against India he briefly became the leading keeper in Test cricket by overtaking Mark Boucher, then the following day announced his retirement from international cricket.\n"

            "\nA man to go to war with, but never against, Mark Boucher packed all the archetypal attributes of the South African cricketer into his short, stocky frame. He was relentlessly competitive, invariably aggressive, and as hard and uncompromising as the new ball. ",
            "Boucher's start in international cricket was uncertain. His relative lack of pure wicketkeeping skill and ability was exposed on South Africa's 1998 tour to England, when he was repeatedly undone by the swing of the ball after it had pitched. However, Boucher had no peer for temperament, guts and determination, and he duly fashioned himself into one of the finest keepers in the game with endless hours of practice and drills. ",
            "As a batter he lived for the big moment, the quick 30 or 40 his team needed to win a match, or the session that had to be spent at the crease to ensure a draw. His most memorable innings was probably the scintillating unbeaten 50 he scored to complete South Africa's surge to a series-clinching target of 435 off the penultimate ball of a one-day international against Australia in Johannesburg in March 2006. ",
            "Boucher played 75 consecutive Tests before the suits thought he needed to be brought down a peg or two and dropped him for the tour to India in 2004. His reality duly checked, he returned to the national team as the ultimate man for the trenches. In the autumn of his career, his renewed commitment to his conditioning earned him extra years at the top, and helped him become the first wicketkeeper to take 500 catches in Test cricket. ",
            "For a man who loomed so large in cricket, Boucher started diminutively. He was invariably smaller and younger than anyone else in the age-group provincial teams he played in. But the neon intensity in his eyes in the otherwise banal team photographs told of a kid who meant business. Boucher was a junior South African squash champion, and famously once played a national final with a racquet arm that had not long before emerged from a plaster cast. He lost, but in five games. ",
            "After an international career that lasted almost 15 years, the end was desperately unfortunate: Boucher was forced to announce his retirement after being hit in the eye by a bail in a warm-up game on the tour to England in 2012. He finished with 998 international dismissals as a wicketkeeper, including 555 in 147 Tests, the all-time record.",
            "He then turned to coaching, taking over at Titans in 2016 and leading them to five domestic titles. In 2019 he was appointed head coach of the South Africa national side, and in 2022, head coach of Mumbai Indians in the IPL.\n"

            "Sam Curran, younger brother of Tom Curran, his fellow Surrey all-rounder, and son of the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran, fulfilled his destiny at the age of 19 years and 363 days, when he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley in June 2018. One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit. ",
            "Perhaps the only real conclusion to that debate is it does not matter. Curran has developed into an X-factor cricketer of global repute. He was player of the T20 World Cup in 2022, taking 13 wickets at 11.38, with an economy rate of 6.52, emerging as a canny death bowler to take England to glory. He signed off with a player of the match performance in the final against Pakistan, taking 3 for 12. ",
            "Punjab Kings subsequently made him the most expensive buy at an IPL auction, outbidding five other teams to acquire his services for INR 18.50 crore (£1.85 million approximately). Back in 2018, the same franchise - Kings XI Pubjab, as they were known at the time - purchased him for INR 7.2 crore (£800,000 approximately). It was at the IPL, while playing for Chennai Super Kings, he showed his dexterity as a makeshift opening batter, having primarily been used as a hitter down the order. ",
            "His absence from Test duties in 2022 was more through circumstance than design. A back injury ruled him out of the 2021/22 Ashes which took time to shake off. Now, however, both player and national team are aligned. As a leftie in both disciplines, his skillset is a rarity as far as English red ball bowling stocks are concerned, and his composure with bat in hand has never been questioned. Having fallen in the nineties twice in first class cricket, he finally made it to three figures in June 2022 with 126 against Kent. It was his 120th innings in the format. ",
            "Curran has belied his slight frame from the moment he entered Surrey's 1st X1 in 2015, showing a natural ability to swing his left-armers at a decent lick and full of ambition at the crease. The combative nature of his cricket marked him down as a special cricketer in the making, winning attention from England Lions at the end of the 2016 season.",
            "Curran made an eye-catching Championship debut against Kent at The Oval when he took five wickets in the first innings, eight in all in the match, at only 17. Surrey research suggested he was the youngest-ever player to achieve a five-wicket haul in the Championship and the second youngest Surrey debutant. He opened the bowling with his brother, Tom, and took a wicket with his fifth ball when an inswinger bowled Joe Denly. At 17 years and 40 days old, his first-class debut came 69 years to the day after Tony Lock, the youngest player to play for Surrey at 17 years and eight days, made his first appearance - also against Kent - at the Oval on July 13, 1946. ",
            "He showed an ability to swing the ball into the right-hander from the outset. That there was aggression, too, was evident even before his debut when he filled in for a Surrey T20 practice match and struck Gary Wilson on the helmet with one of the first balls he bowled. His laid-back personality was also evident when he was given a day off school by Wellington College, where he was taking A levels in PE, Art and Business Studies, to play in a Royal London Cup semi-final against Nottinghamshire at The Oval, where he first came to the attention of a wider audience with a composed, energetic display.",
            "Two successive runners-up medals in the Royal London Cup final, as Surrey lost Lord's finals against Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, were not a bad start for a player still only 18, but such is Curran's competitive nature, it is doubtful that he found much consolation in either of them. In a 2016 summer that brought so much to admire with bat and ball, there was a 96 against Lancashire - ended when a tame return catch to the offspinner Arron Lilley was followed by a disconsolate walk from the crease, in the words of ESPNcricinfo's reporter, as if he had just lost a game of Pokemon Go - and four wickets in seven ball against Durham on the way to the first six-for of his Championship career."

            "Barely five foot tall and light on his feet, Tatenda Taibu is a throwback to the traditional style of wicketkeeper, and his importance to Zimbabwean cricket was underlined when he was named as vice-captain for the tour of England in 2003, when only 19 years old. Earmarked as the long-term successor to club colleague Andy Flower, Taibu was plucked from Churchill Boys High School to tour the West Indies in 1999-00, after impressing onlookers with his natural ability. Three months later he was in England, on stand-by at Trent Bridge after injury put Flower's dual role in doubt. He had yet to play domestic first-class cricket at this stage - his debut for Mashonaland had to be put on hold after he turned up at the wrong ground - but he has toured South Africa with the Zimbabwe U-19s, and was one of Zimbabwe's few bright spots in the 2003 World Cup and their tour to England later that year. A promising batsman, albeit with a penchant for cross-batted strokes, he is steadily improving at Test and ODI level.",
            "In April 2004, he was appointed captain of Zimbabwe following the resignation of Heath Streak, and he led a woefully inexperienced by example in the face of repeated heavy defeats.  But the pressure began to tell, and by the autumn of 2005 he found himself at the front of another players revolt, this time widely backed and against the general  mismanagement of the board.  It led to him being villified in the domestic press and threatened by some unsavoury elements connected to the board itself, and in November 2005 he announced his resignation as captain and his retirement from international cricket. Of all the high-profile departures from the game in  Zimbabwe, none were felt so deeply as Taibu - a home-grown product,  a world-class wicketkeeper-batsman, and the country's first black captain.   ",
            "After spells in Bangladesh and England, he moved to South Africa later in 2006 and made clear his intention to sit out the four-year qualification to try to play international cricket for them.  But it didn't work out, and to more than a few raised eyebrows he reappeared in Zimbabwe colours in mid 2007.",
            "Taibu announced his retirement from international cricket in July 2012, aged 29 years, after a topsy-turvy career spanning more than a decade. "

            "As a child Shaun Marsh spent a lot of time in the Australian set-up travelling with his father Geoff, the former opening batsman. The international grounding and a backyard net helped develop Marsh into one of the finest, if not enigmatic, talents in Australian cricket. The elegant left-hander made his first-class debut for Western Australia as a 17-year-old and scored a century as a 19-year-old against New South Wales in 2003 in a game where then Test veterans Steve and Mark Waugh were playing. He eventually progressed to international ranks making a successful start to his ODI career in 2008 and scoring a superb century on Test debut in Sri Lanka in 2011. ",
            "Marsh looked set for a lengthy tenure as Australia's No.3 but a back injury suffered during Australia's disastrous Cape Town Test later that year proved a serious setback. Marsh rejoined the side for the home Tests against India but was a shadow of himself, and 17 runs from six innings was a calamitous return. He went into a tailspin that saw him dropped from WA's Sheffield Shield side before Justin Langer's arrival as WA coach resurrected his career. He was recalled for the 2014 Test tour of South Africa and scored 148 at Centurion, but was dropped again after making a pair in the next Test.  Another recall came at home against India when Michael Clarke was injured, and 99 at the MCG suggested he still had something to offer. ",
            "But in his only Test on the 2015 Ashes tour he scored 0 and 2, and it seemed that might have been his last chance. Until he was given another, included to replace the injured Usman Khawaja for the inaugural day-night Test against New Zealand in 2015-16. Permanency has never arrived, however, through a mixture of form and injury. It felt as though the 2017-18 Ashes promised something better with two hundreds in the series, including one against the pink ball in Adelaide, but there was a subsequent slump in form that again that saw him dropped from the Test side after the 2018-19 home series loss to India. ",
            "Marsh remains one of the great enigmas of Australian cricket. Despite his incredible peaks and troughs in form Australian selection panels continually view him as a viable top-order prospect in Tests and ODIs especially. While his poor Test run in 2018-19 led to his eventual omission from the team, his ODI form was impressive, making four ODI centuries in 12 months to get himself into the 2019 World Cup squad. He was also handed a CA contract for 2019-20 aged 35 and only playing in the ODI team. ",
            "He has been an outstanding T20 franchise player despite not playing much T20 international cricket and was the leading run-scorer and named Player of the IPL in 2008 for Kings XI Punjab. He was the leading run-scorer in BBL 02, helping Perth Scorchers to the final, and made 63 and 73 in the finals of both BBL 03 and BBL 04 to help the Scorchers to back-to-back titles. In 2019 he left the Scorchers and signed a three-year deal with the Melbourne Renegades. "

A positive captain who led from the front, he had little problem motivating his side - as demonstrated when Ireland bounced back from a disappointing World Cricket League in Kenya, where they finished 5th, to demolish the United Arab Emirates and qualify for the final of the Intercontinental Cup. He tore the heart out of the UAE batting line up in their second innings taking three for eight from his eight overs as Ireland recorded a morale-boosting victory by an innings and 170 runs. He led Ireland to a thrilling tie against Zimbabwe in their first match of the 2007 World Cup before beating Pakistan - Johnston hit the winning runs - to record one of the biggest upsets in history.",

",
            "In April 2009 Johnston's career-best figures of 5 for 14 set up Ireland's win over Canada in the final of the ICC World Cup Qualifiers, and later that year he came within a whisker of securing the first Irish victory over England with a fine allround display as he ripped through the top order with four wickets and then hit an unbeaten 20 that couldn't quite get Ireland home. Though time is running out for Johnston, he remains a consistent performer for Ireland and will be a vital member of their squad at the 2011 World Cup. "

In the following year's tournament, in Mohali, he cracked a match-winning 93-ball hundred for India B. The reward was a place in the senior India side in the final ODI of the home series against England early in 2006, and he capitalised with a well-paced 86.

That resulted in him being dropped from the Indian team, and he also had a few fairly ordinary seasons in domestic cricket. He made a comeback in 2013-14, when his side, Karnataka, won the Ranji Trophy, Irani Cup and Vijay Hazare Trophy. Uthappa followed that up with an outstanding IPL in 2014, in which he scored 40 or more in ten successive innings for title winners Kolkata Knight Riders, and was the leading run-scorer of the tournament. The reward was a place in the Indian team for the tour to Bangladesh for the ODI series in 2014, where he made a fifty in a series of rain-interrupted matches.",

He played another handful of white-ball games for India in 2015, which proved to be his last international appearances. ",

            "Born in Pakistan, Khawaja moved with his family to Australia when he was a young boy, and in the 2011 Sydney Ashes Test became the first Muslim to play for Australia. Batting at No. 3 in place of the injured Ricky Ponting, he made 37 and 21 and showed impressive poise, giving Australia a ray of hope in a series that had brought them little but doom and gloom. A classy left-hander in the languid style of David Gower, Khawaja won further Test opportunities from 2011 to 2013 but never quite kicked on beyond his regularly appealing starts. ",
            "A move from New South Wales to Queensland in 2012 helped to reinvigorate his career; he declared his enjoyment of the game had ebbed away in Sydney. A serious knee injury suffered in late 2014 put him out of action for six months, but when he returned to captain Australia A on the 2015 tour of India he impressed Rod Marsh's selection panel, and further leadership opportunities came when he was named captain of Queensland for the 2015-16 season. In the same season he proved himself as a quality T20 player by dominating the BBL with four superb innings, including two unbeaten centuries, to guide Sydney Thunder to the title. He also established himself in the Test team in 2015-16 and played consistently well in matches at home but struggled away, particularly in Asia where lost his place in the side on tours of Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh.",
            "But Khawaja's subcontinent demons were finally slayed in the UAE in 2018 when he made an epic match-saving century against Pakistan in Dubai. He became Australia's most senior batter while Steve Smith and David Warner were banned following the ball-tampering scandal and settled himself in the ODI team with two outstanding tours of India and the UAE in 2019, making his first two ODI centuries to ensure selection in the 2019 World Cup squad."

Particularly in South Africa he had his supporters and detractors who debated his destructive yet inconsistent career and bulky frame.",
            "Levi, a student of the Cape Ivy League schools, represented South Africa in the Under-19 World Cup in 2006, and quickly developed a reputation as a fearsome striker of the new ball, especially in the shortest format. Two Twenty20s into his international career, no one was in doubt of his abilities. In February 2012, opening the innings in South Africa's chase of 174 against New Zealand, Levi plundered 13 sixes - a record - in an unbeaten 117 off 51 balls, at the time the highest score in a T20I. He reached his century off 45 balls, also setting a new record of its day for the fastest ton in Twenty20 internationals. Granted, the Seddon Park in Hamilton isn't the biggest ground, but several of Levi's strikes sailed well past the boundary, and would have been sixes in most arenas. ",
            "Hopes that Levi's success could provide South Africa with an exciting long-term replacement for Graeme Smith at the top of the order in the limited-overs formats soon foundered. His weight ballooned, his predominantly legside style did not suit everybody and he was deemed weak against spin: there was an uncultured feel about him, but his destructive qualities were evident."

He recorded the fastest fifty of the IPL's first season - off 21 balls against Deccan Chargers - and his dazzling all-round show in the final was instrumental in Royals' triumph. But then a run of patchy scores in India's limited-overs squads had Yusuf dropped, but he replied with emphatically with a 190-ball, unbeaten, double century as West Zone sealed the highest first-class chase ever in the 2010 Duleep Trophy final.

But the fade of his Australian football career around his 20th birthday left him to fall back on the other sport that had competed for his junior attention, starting a road to becoming Australia's wicketkeeper across formats and also a vice-captain of the ODI side.",

On returning home from Sydney, Carey excelled in grade ranks as a batsman, but found the going harder when first chosen for the Redbacks in early 2013. These struggles led the adaptable Carey to make another switch, from full-time batter to a wicketkeeper-batter down the order, and it was in this form that he was able to progress. Amid a strong club and 2nd XI season in 2015-16, he displaced Tim Ludeman as South Australia's gloveman, and earned strong reviews for his precise footwork, soft hands and promising, elegant batting.",

He quickly replaced Paine in the ODI team and remarkably became vice-captain of both limited-overs teams in the aftermath of Australian cricket's cultural review, cementing his place for the 2019 ODI World Cup. Two years later, he captained the ODI side in a series against West Indies."

            "John Mooney is a combative allrounder for Ireland. His skill was highlighted in Ireland's famous victory over England in Bangalore at the 2011 World Cup. Mooney took 4 for 63 in England's innings, restricting the batsmen at the death with cutters, yorkers and slower balls. But his contribution with the bat was even more significant. Mooney was clinical in clinching Ireland's win, finishing with 33 not out from 30 balls and hitting the winnings runs when he clipped Jimmy Anderson to the midwicket boundary. ",
            "Mooney made his ODI debut alongside his older brother Paul in Ireland's maiden ODI, against England in June 2006. He contributed with bat and ball, claiming the wickets of Marcus Trescothick, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood - though he conceded 79 from his ten overs - and then hit an unbeaten 30. But he was a peripheral player for Ireland in the 2007 World Cup, going wicketless in his two games. After the tournament, he took a break from international cricket to complete his electrical apprenticeship, but returned when he was qualified and was established as a regular in the Ireland team by the World Cup. ",
            "In April 2013 he was suspended for three matches by Cricket Ireland for an insensitive tweet about the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The following February he left Ireland's tour of the West Indies and took a break from the game due a stress-related illness which had been managed for some time. In a highly revealing interview in September 2014, Mooney admitted the extent of his struggle with depression, saying that he had even contemplated committing suicide. The following day he made a sublime 96 against Scotland, marked by crisp late cuts, and the Malahide crowd were distraught that he just missed out on a maiden ODI century. But more important was that Mooney was enjoying cricket again and had proved his continuing worth in the Ireland side ahead of the 2015 World Cup. "

            "Naturally competitive, willing to innovate, capable of changing a game with bat or ball, stunning run-out or implausible catch, David Willey has a lot going for him as a limited-overs cricketer. ",
            "His attacking approach as a left-arm quick and a clean-hitting batter first won him an international cap against Ireland in 2015 and he was regular member of England's ODI squads through that four-year cycle, but was squeezed out on the eve of the 2019 World Cup by the newly qualified Jofra Archer. ",
            "The son of former England allrounder turned umpire Peter Willey, David had long been recognised as feisty character on the county circuit before England came calling. Less than a year after his debut, he was a key part of the England side at the 2016 T20 World Cup. With 21 off 14 balls and 3 for 20 from his four overs, Willey would have been a contender for Player of the Match in the final if not for one Carlos Brathwaite.",
            "Although he hasn't played a lot of long-form cricket since, Willey started off his first-class career in 2009 with a half-century for Northamptonshire. Initially classed as obdurate, like his father, but with a more orthodox technique, he spent a few seasons of reconnaissance before his combative style began to attract attention. ",
            "His bowling developed during the 2012 season when he claimed 43 first-class wickets with his brisk swing and seam. The following summer he was central to Northants' T20 success with a memorable all-round performance in the final: a 19-ball half-century (the fastest of the season), a direct-hit run-out from the deep, and a hat-trick to finish off the match as part of a four-wicket haul.",
            "A back stress fracture followed by shoulder surgery prevented him from progressing beyond the Lions squad in time for the 2015 World Cup, but he was eventually picked for an experimental England side in Malahide. Further ODI and T20I opportunities followed.",
            "In the 2015 Blast, he struck a match-winning century against Sussex in the quarter-final, including 34 off an over from the former England slow left-armer Mike Yardy. He destroyed Warwickshire's top order in the semi-final before Lancashire overcame Northants in the final.",
            "At the end of the season, he joined Yorkshire, helping them to Finals Day in 2016, and hitting a career-best 118 from 55 balls against Worcestershire the following summer. His T20 skills also earned interest from overseas - he won a Big Bash title with Perth Scorchers, and an IPL deal at Chennai Super Kings - and it was in that format that he took on the Yorkshire captaincy in 2020.\n"

            "He was a sporadic performer when chosen in the A side, yet was immediately effective in Tests, hitting a fifty and a hundred in his first three international innings, against Zimbabwe. With Angelo Mathews ruled out of that tour, Gunaratne also earned a place in the ODI squad, and made an impact with his dibbly-dobbly slow-medium bowling, claiming eight wickets at an average of 14.5 as Sri Lanka won the tri-nations trophy in Zimbabwe, in November 2016. He had an impact in the shortest format too, helping Sri Lanka claim a T20 series in Australia in February 2017 by knocking off 84 in 46 balls in Geelong - three consecutive sixes in the penultimate over included, in a chase of 174.

He made his one-day international debut in the final, against England at Lord's, in which South Africa were thumped by seven wickets. However, despite being earmarked as Mark Boucher's long-term replacement his opportunities were limited. He made is Twenty20 international debut against Pakistan in 2007 in which he did not bat and played one further T20 International against West Indies at the end of 2007, a match that South Africa was bowled out for 58."

But he found it hard to take to first-class cricket. Brooks wanted to be an electrical engineer if not a cricketer, a switch that might have played on his mind when he was dropped by Barbados in 2012, having made only one fifty after his debut in 2007.",

In 2015, Brooks made 124 against Windward Islands in his first innings back, followed it up with two more hundreds in the same year, and was immediately back in the West Indies' plans with a Board President's XI call-up against Australia."

            "At the height of his powers, Tim Bresnan became known as England's lucky charm, but it was in his beloved Yorkshire where he most deeply treasured. Strong-willed, independent and with an understated sense of humour, he perfectly captured the stereotype of the self-made Yorkshire sportsman. \"A doer more than a thinker\" he once said about himself, but he was sharp-witted on and off the field, had an impressive hold on reality and a healthy suspicion of fads and fancies.",
            "A powerfully built allrounder, Bresnan had been tipped for higher honours since he became the youngest player in 20 years to represent Yorkshire when he debuted in 2001. It was nearly a decade later that he really announced his arrival in the big-time, however, with a phenomenal performance in the fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne in December 2010. Called into the side as a replacement for Steven Finn, and with a remit to keep the runs down, he starred with a performance of skill, pace and unrelenting accuracy. First, he played a key role in bowling Australia out for 98 in the first innings, then he sealed England's successful defence of the Ashes with 4 for 50 in the second innings.",
            "Such was his understated value to the side that England won the first 13 Tests he played in - a record bettered only by Adam Gilchrist. At that point, having taken eight wickets against West Indies at Trent Bridge, Bresnan averaged 40 with the bat and 25 with the ball but the lingering effects of an elbow injury that required surgery in late 2011 were about to take their toll. He claimed only five wickets in his next five Tests - and two in four against South Africa and India - before undergoing another operation at the start of 2013. He returned to the ODI team for their run to the Champions Trophy final and then picked up four wickets in England's crushing Ashes win at Lord's but his utility had been diminished and he became a victim of England's subsequent Ashes whitewash in Australia, his international career limited after that to limited-overs formats.",
            "Bresnan began his international career in the England Under-19 set-up and was part of the team in 2002 and 2003 - playing in two World Cups - the same years that he won the NBC Denis Compton Award for most promising Yorkshire player. All the potential took a few years to develop, but 2005 was an important year for him as he was given more responsibility in a transitional Yorkshire team. He was surprisingly overlooked for the England Academy, but started 2006 with a string of impressive performances with bat and ball, leading to a call-up to England's new-look one-day squad to face Sri Lanka. However, he fell victim to the flashing blades of Jayasuriya and co., then suffered injury in the second half of the season as he lost his place for the series against Pakistan.",
            "A better all-round summer in 2008 helped him catch the selectors' eyes again, however, and he was called up late in the season for the one-day squad. But after a winter without any honours it appeared he would have to bide his time again before he was surprisingly named in the Test squad to face West Indies. He duly played in both matches, but such was England's dominance it wasn't until the final day of the series that he finally made his mark. He claimed his maiden Test wicket in the second innings and eventual figures of 3 for 45, as West Indies slumped to an innings defeat.",
            "While he hovered around the fringes of the Test side thereafter injuries during England's tour to Bangladesh in 2010 opened the door and he impressed, showing good discipline and stamina in trying conditions. He then played an important role in delivering England the 2010 World Twenty20, showing skill and an unfailing ability to hit his straps early to give England control with the new ball, before returning at the end of the innings with steely death-bowling. ",
            "Injuries than began to hamper him. A second operation on a troublesome right elbow caused him to miss the 2013 tour to New Zealand. He returned to England's colours adamant that his pace, which he admitted had been reduced because of the injury, had been restored, but it was hard to accept the claim as he struggled like many of his colleagues during England's 5-0 whitewash in Australia in 2013/14. He did not represent England in Tests the following summer. His zip had gone, however, later evidenced by a third elbow operation after the 2016 season. But he committed himself instead to back-to-back Yorkshire Championship wins were his down-to-earth approach, on and off the field, remained highly prized. ",
            "An unbeaten hundred against Somerset was his first since 2007 and an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 366 with Jonny Bairstow against Durham at Chester-le-Street - both batsmen making career-best scores - emphasised Yorkshire's might. It was a record stand against Durham, the third-highest seventh-wicket stand in the history of first-class cricket and it is the fifth-highest for Yorkshire, the other four all being opening partnerships. But it was his redoubtable efforts in 2016 that won Yorkshire hearts as much as ever before: Yorkshire conceded the chance of a hat-trick of Championship titles on the final evening of the season, at Lord's, against the side that took their crown, Middlesex, but Bresnan's defiant, unbeaten 142 ensured they did not concede it without a fight in an innings that would enter Yorkshire folklore. ",
            "His career-best figures in any format came on an extraordinary, wet night at Headingley when he returned 6 for 19 before a sold-out Roses T20 crowd. Four wickets came in his last over, three to Bresnan plus a run-out that he made off his own bowling, enough to tempt him into a knee slide across the outfield in the pouring rain. \"Knee sliding at 32,\" he said afterwards, in disbelief."

His 44 from 23 balls to clinch the SLPL title for the Uva Next franchise included five sixes and two fours. ",

He had been in and out of the Sri Lanka A team prior to national selection, but had marked himself out as a future talent nonetheless, first as a teenager when he struck six consecutive sixes in the Ananda-Nalanda school cricket match, and later by winning a single-wicket tournament organised by SLC.

He featured in several overseas domestic T20 tournaments over the following years however, the Caribbean Premier League and Bangladesh Premier League among them. His success at those events, and an improving record in Sri Lanka's domestic tournaments, paved the way for his re-selection to the Sri Lanka squad - for a T20 tour to Australia in February 2017. "

His nickname of Bozie came from \"bulldozer\" because his grandmother observed that he was in the habit of bulldozing around. He has done that to good purpose both for South Africa and, latterly, Glamorgan, where he has gained a reputation as a destructive one-day hitter, the most potent figure by far in their T20 side.",
            "His 31 ODIs for South Africa came with three centuries (one on debut against Zimbabwe, two against Pakistan) and he played 9 T20s but he lacked consistency at an average of not much above 30 meant that by the end of 2013 he had fallen out of favour. He also bowled six balls in his ODI career and conceded 17 in one over against Pakistan. \"Misbah-ul-Haq was on strike and I tossed one of my leggies up and he clubbed it for six,\" he said later. \"I turned round and said, 'Let's see if you can do it again' - and he did.\"",
            "He signed a Kolpak deal with Glamorgan for the 2015 season, combining that with captaincy of the Eastern Cape-based Warriors. Justification was not hard to find: here was a player with 31 ODIs and nine T20Is spaced out between 2010 and 2013, who batted in every position across the top seven. \"I definitely feel I held my own at international level and put in performances,\" he said. \"Unfortunately I ran into a few really good bowlers when I ended up opening, which wasn't my preferred position. It was an unsettling period because I did move around, I was in and out of the side and I didn't feel backed.\"",
            "The move to Glamorgan was cathartic.  His menace was obvious in all competitions in 2015, but his 2016 season was inhibited by a knee injury, suffered at the start of the season, which restricted him to white-ball cricket. He had surgery in South Africa at the end of the season, insisting that his appetite for red-ball cricket remained, only to become a limited-overs specialist a year later.",

He scored 502 runs in the 2016 T20 Blast season, hitting 29 sixes to share the record with Chris Gayle, and also topped Glamorgan's One-Day Cup averages with 367 runs at 61.1. His legspin was another useful weapon: he took a career-best 3 for 20 against Somerset to get Glamorgan into the last eight of the NatWest Blast, but an improvement on that figure as he took 4 for 32 in the quarter-final against Yorkshire in Cardiff could not prevent Glamorgan's elimination."

            "Though foremost a batsman who scores heavily square of the wicket, it is for his unique skill set with the ball that Kamindu Mendis had gained an international reputation long before he entered a national squad. He bowls finger spin with both arms, and does it with skill and accuracy - his offbreaks not quite as good as his left-arm orthodox, but not far off. Understandably, his potential has impressed coaches. In the age of T20, a bowler who can spin it away from both right and left-handers, not to mention employ different lines of attack to the same batsman, could potentially have team owners and data analysts drooling, so long as Kamindu continues to develop those skills. ",
            "A product of Galle's Richmond College, Mendis made his under-19 Sri Lanka debut shortly before his 16th birthday, and would go on to captain the under-19 side in the 2018 World Cup. In October of that year, he was picked in a Sri Lanka senior side for the first time, for the one-off T20 against England. A half-century in the practice match before that England tour had helped him secure a place. \n"

Filling a Lance Klusener-like role to perfection, he lumped 80 from 50 balls in the series clincher in East London, and in a five-match series at home against New Zealand later that year, Kemp began to look like the complete package. Kemp's crucial innings of 73 off 64 - complete with 3 sixes - and a 19-ball 30 to clinch the series in the third match played their in establishing him as one of the biggest and best hitters in the game, and he was duly named Man of the Series after those performances. ",
            "In February 2006, Kemp and fellow South African team-mate Andrew Hall returned to English county side Kent. After a successful few months, Kemp was released as South African authorities urged him to rest up ahead of a tour to Sri Lanka and the World Cup in 2007. A couple of good innings in the 2006 Champions Trophy preceded Kemp's maiden ODI hundred - an awe-inspiring unbeaten 100 against India at Cape Town in late November. His World Cup campaign, however, was a stop-start affair, as was the World Twenty20 and soon after the tournament he was dropped. He did not play international cricket again. ",

In his first Test, against Australia, Smith scored a blazing 62 in a losing cause, but failed to score in the next Test. A good eye compensates for his lack of footwork and throughout the series he showed promise, but it wasn't enough, and he was dropped to smooth off the rough edges. In 2004, he was selected to open against England, and he immediately pulled his team out of a hole with a stroke-filled century. But just as he began to settle into a groove, a freak net injury left him with a fractured thumb, and he missed the next two Tests. He was axed after another failure in the Test series against Australia in 2005-06 and spent two years in the wilderness. He returned to play in the one-dayers against India in 2006-07 and was picked for the World Cup squad where his form was solid rather than spectacular. He failed to move out of first gear against England in 2007, and he followed with a horror tour of Zimbabwe and South Africa that was only saved by his ODI career-best 91 in Johannesburg. ",

Botha reworked his action but it was confirmed once again in September that he bent his arm more than 15 degrees. However, after another review in November, Botha's action was cleared by the ICC. More recently, he underwent biomechanical analysis and was cleared by Cricket Australia after being reported by the umpires in a domestic one-day match in October 2013."

            "With his disguised pace variations and the illusion of a wrong-footed action, left-armer Sohail Tanvir was among the first of Pakistani T20 specialists, making a name in leagues around the world. He had played for over 20 sides, at last count, including the first 13 seasons of Pakistan's domestic T20 Cup for Rawalpindi Rams.",

But though he was a regular in the Rawalpindi line-up in first-class cricket through the first two decades of the 21st century, it was in the shortest format that he shone. He came into the first T20 World Cup, in 2007, as Shoaib Akhtar's replacement off the back of a fine showing on a Pakistan Academy side tour of Bangladesh and against Australia A at home. His 6 for 14 for Rajasthan Royals in their run to the title in the first season of the IPL soon after was the best bowling performance in the tournament for over a decade. Later in 2008, he signed for Southern Redbacks in the pre-BBL KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, and in early 2012 featured in the first edition of the Bangladesh Premier League.\n"

            "Fawad Alam, son of Pakistan's famous first-class cricketer Tariq Alam, made his first-class debut at the age of 17. He was duly picked to represent Pakistan at the U-19 World Cup based on his performances with Pakistan Customs and Karachi on the domestic circuit.",
            "An unbeaten 43 in the semi-final against India not only guided Pakistan to the final (which they went on to win), but also marked his status as an immensely talented left-handed allrounder (something that Pakistan agonisingly lacks). ",
            "He was then named in the U-19 squad to play the touring Sri Lankans and South Africa Academy teams. That same year, he was invited to join the National Cricket Academy (NCA), a pool of talented individuals to be groomed for the elite level.",
            "His real breakthrough was the 2006-07 season where Fawad outshone the rest by miles. He guided Karachi Dolphins to the final of the Twenty20 Cup (losing to defending champions Sialkot Stallions) where he not only grabbed a five-wicket haul and scored a valiant 54, but also went home with the Man of the Final, Man of the Series, Best Batsman and Best Bowler awards.",
            "He also scored heavily in the longer version of the game namely the Quaid-e-Azam trophy where he finished as the fifth highest run-scorer. In the shorter version of the game, he turned out to be a useful ingredient of the National Bank mix that lifted the Patron's Cup, almost carried Karachi Dolphins to the ABN AMRO Cup final (second highest run-scorer and highest wicket-taker in the competition).",
            "After an intense, but profitable, first-class season, Fawad was selected to captain the Pakistan Academy's tour of Bangladesh where his performance was deemed adequate enough for a call to the national squad. Fawad, however, failed to shine on his international debut in the searing Abu Dhabi conditions aged 21. Surprisingly not required to bowl at all, Fawad also fell first ball to cap off a lacklustre debut. The selectors, however, kept their trust in the young allrounder, giving him opportunities in Pakistan's limited-overs squads. Fawad was the leading run-getter during Pakistan Academy's tour of Africa in September-October 2008; he scored 302 not out in a four-day game against Kenya.",
            "Presumably that would set Fawad up for a long, illustrious career? Well, yes, but also very much no. A call-up to a Test tour of Sri Lanka saw him score 168 on debut, but after two further Tests with few runs to his name, he was dropped. That's usually not too big a worry in Pakistan; people keep getting dropped and picked up again almost every other series, but what would happen to Fawad was Kafkaesque in its surreal nightmarishness. ",
            "Fawad became one of the most prolific first-class batsmen in Pakistan cricket history, and holds the record for the highest batting average for any Pakistan first-class batter ever. That has been true since 2013, and from the 2015-16 season onwards, no one in Pakistan score more first-class runs. He averaged in the high 50s with 40 first-class hundreds; no batsman on the domestic circuit ever really coming close. ",
            "But for the next 11 years, coaches and selectors in Pakistan produced streams of reasons that rendered him ill-suited to the international stage. Batters with decidedly inferior records were called up, enjoyed a few Tests here and there, but the door was firmly shut on Fawad. In this time, he went through a stylistic transformation of his own; his crab-like batting stance means he's side-on, almost facing mid-on, when the bowler runs in, like a Shivnarine Chanderpaul tribute act. It might look ugly, but the results were phenomenal.  ",
            "Finally, in 2019, Fawad was called up to the national side for a home series against Sri Lanka, fittingly enough, but continued to warm the bench for the best part of a further year. He got his chance in England, and on that long-awaited return, managed only a four-ball duck. Quality, however, ultimately shines through, and a heroic fourth innings hundred in Mount Maunganui that took Pakistan to within minutes of securing an impossible draw finally marked his return to where he truly belonged: the highest level of the game. ",
            "A century in an attritional home win against South Africa followed a month later, and a couple more in Zimbabwe and West Indies in 2021. At 35, Fawad's career has a second wind, but he might wonder if he got a fair crack of his first.  "

A Test call-up followed later that year, and Shafiq justified his selection, scoring 61 on debut against South Africa in Abu Dhabi.",
            "Between 2010 and 2018, Shafiq was reasonably consistent as a Test batter, showing spunk and flair in the middle order. Against Bangladesh in 2011 he scored his maiden Test century, and against South Africa in 2013 he made a Test hundred in tough conditions in Cape Town: coming in to bat at 33 for 4, he added 219 with Younis Khan and scored 111 against an attack that included Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander and Morne Morkel. In 2016, he struck 137 against Australia, bringing Pakistan excruciatingly close to what would have been a famous victory at the Gabba. It also took him past Garry Sobers' record for the most centuries scored from No. 6.",
            "A product of the Karachi tape-ball circuit, Shafiq was first noticed when he stormed the first-class scene in his debut season, 2007-08, scoring a double-hundred. He fell short of 1000 runs that season, but got to the milestone two seasons later, when he scored 1244 runs in 12 games at 49.76. He made an impact as a limited-overs player in 2008-09, when he scored 379 runs in seven games at 54.14, which fetched him a call-up for the Asia Cup in 2010."

",
            "Samit's bugbear was having to repeatedly convince England that his fitness levels were acceptable; it was a feat he never entirely managed, not helped by the fact that the left-arm slows that made him an especially tempting option in Asia turned out to lack the guile to trouble the best players. ",
            "He represented England at Under-15, U-17 and U-19 levels, and in his breakthrough international season, 2008, played 11 ODIs, impressing particularly with the 5 for 41 that beat South Africa at The Oval. But instead of kicking on to greater things, his career stagnated amid repeated failures to sort out his waistline. ",
            "In 2011, when he did reach the basic fitness targets laid out by England, he was rewarded with a recall to the limited-overs set-up, his first international involvement for two and a half years. That season was the first in which he made over 1000 first-class runs, to go with 33 wickets, for Nottinghamshire. And he was one of few players to come out of England's poor tour of India in credit with 160 runs at 40. Samit earned a first Test call-up for England's tour of Sri Lanka in March 2012. On that tour, and his next, the one of India the following season, he did not make an impact. He won a surprise call-up as England's third spinner for a Test series against Pakistan in the UAE in 2015, taking three wickets in the third Test, a Pakistan win.",
            "That was it for his international career, though in county cricket there was much more on either side. His 3 for 21 from seven overs took Nottinghamshire to their first limited-pvers trophy in over 20 years when they won the 2013 Yorkshire Bank 40 title. And he was at the forefront of the club's excellent 2017 season, when they made it back to the first division in the Championship and won both limited-overs trophies. That year, he made an unbeaten 122 against Essex as Notts pulled off a record 50-over chase in the semi-final. And he was the Player-of-the-Match in the T20 final at Edgbaston for his 64 off 42 balls against Birmingham Bears. "

            "Ian Bell, much admired by the purists, who could swoon over his cover drive when he was in full flow, filled English cricket with elegance in a career that brought 118 Tests, 169 caps in limited-overs formats and a stack of first-class runs for Warwickshire. He never quite achieved the greatness that some predicted for him as a teenager, but he was a very fine player at international level and English cricket lost a little grace when he played his last Test against Pakistan in Sharjah in November 2015.",
            "Even after his international days were over, Bell retained that boyish image at the crease for Warwickshire that in the most physically-demanding periods often made him appear a slight and slightly vulnerable figure, but one unfurled cover drive later and his game could flow like few others. ",
            "Once described by Dayle Hadlee as the best 16-year-old he had ever seen, Bell had been earmarked for greatness long before he was drafted onto the England tour of New Zealand in 2001-02, as cover for the injured Mark Butcher. He was immediately burdened with similar expectations when he made his England debut. His most fluent early efforts tended to come about when the pressure was off, a trait that belied an average above 40 and a record of a century every five or so Tests.",
            "However, on the tour of South Africa in 2009-10, Bell set about changing those perceptions. A perfectly paced century while batting at No. 6 in Durban set England up for an innings victory that ranked, at the time, among their finest overseas performances for a generation, but he surpassed that effort in the very next Test in Cape Town, with a backs-to-the-wall 78 that saved the match and ensured a share of the series. On the subsequent tour of Australia, he continued to save his best for when the chips were down, particularly during England's first-innings struggles at Brisbane and Perth. He finished the tour on a high with his maiden Ashes hundred at Sydney, and a reputation transformed.",
            "When in form, Bell was always been adept at leaving the ball outside off stump, and he received glowing reviews from coaches at every stage of his development, not least from Rod Marsh at the England Academy, a man not given to hyperbole. A former England U19 captain, Bell had played just 13 first-class games when called into the England squad, though in 2001 he scored 836 runs for Warwickshire at an average of over 64, including three centuries.",
            "He didn't immediately translate that success and talent into runs at the international stage - he was found out by Australia's champions, McGrath and Warne, and mustered just 171 runs in ten innings - but he gradually found his feet and his form at the top level. In 2010 and 2011, he averaged more than 65 in five successive series, including the 2010-11 Ashes. But obviously that run wasn't going to last forever: he was brought back to earth by Pakistan's offspinner Saaed Ajmal in the three-Test series in 2012, managing only 51 runs in six innings.",
            "The year was a largely forgettable one in Tests, for Bell and England, though pride was salvaged in India. A first series win in the country since 1984-85 was sealed in Nagpur, where Bell's second-innings hundred made certain of the requisite draw. A reminder of Bell's class came in 50-over cricket, where he made an immaculate transition to opener. That continued into 2013, with his third ODI hundred in lofty Dharamsala, although England were eventually thwarted in their attempts to win global silverware in the Champions Trophy final. He was a casualty of England's grim World Cup campaign in 2015, however, when he seemed unable to translate his talent into the bold stroke-play required and, having been dropped after the tournament, announced his retirement from the format later in the year.",
            "His reputation for producing when England needed him in Test cricket, meanwhile, had been all but banished by a series-defining performance in the Ashes of 2013. Bell scored centuries in each of England's three victories, becoming the first man to reach triple figures in three successive Ashes Tests since Chris Broad in 1986 in the process. He was rewarded with the player of the series award and a place on the shortlist for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year.",
            "He struggled to maintain his form in the return Ashes series in 2013-14 - he averaged just 26.11 compared to 62.44 in England - and then endured a run where he passed 1 only three times in 10 Test innings and averaged 26.87 in the 2015 Ashes. He was dropped from the ODI side after the 2015 World Cup and from the Test side after the year-end tour to the UAE. He was soon appointed captain of Warwickshire and insisted that he retained further ambitions for a Test career that had already included five Ashes-winning series. ",
            "Though England recognition did not come again, Bell enjoyed a fruitful start to his county captaincy, guiding the club to the Royal London One-Day Cup in 2016, before claiming another T20 trophy with Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash. He did not make a Championship century as Warwickshire were relegated in 2017, and he stepped down as skipper towards the end of the season. ",
            "Finally came the realisation that he would never play for England again which led to a run-glut in Warwickshire's promotion season the following year - including two hundreds in a match against Glamorgan at Edbaston - and even encouraged a final burst of speculation, as if for old times' sake, that he might be the man to solve England's batting collapses."

            "- Offspinner R Ashwin has played for five IPL teams since his debut season in 2009, and his most recent franchise is Rajasthan Royals (RR), whom he has been playing for since 2022.",
            "- With 171 wickets before the start of IPL 2024, Ashwin is among the top-five wicket-takers in IPL history.",
            "- Ashwin began his IPL career at Chennai Super Kings (CSK), whom he represented from 2008 to 2015. In the 2011 IPL final between CSK and RCB, MS Dhoni gave Ashwin the new ball and he took the key wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Ashwin's 20 wickets in 2011 is his highest tally in an IPL season to date.",
            "- After CSK were banned for two years following corruption charges, Ashwin played IPL 2016 for Rising Pune Supergiant and missed 2017 because of injury, before moving to Kings XI Punjab (KXIP, now Punjab Kings).",
            "- Ashwin was captain of KXIP from 2018, and in 2019 his mankading (run-out of the non-striker backing-up) of RR batter Jos Buttler became a subject of heated debate.",
            "- Ahead of IPL 2020, Ashwin was traded to Delhi Capitals, where he spent two seasons before moving to RR in 2022. At Royals, he was used up the order as a pinch-hitter and became the first batter to retire out tactically in an IPL game.",
            "R Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century.",
            "All through his career Ashwin has been a cricket nerd with a deep appreciation of the nuances of the game and an acute knowledge of his craft. And it was that sharp brain, along with the carrom ball, an equally good arm ball, and masterly control over his offbreaks that made him a quintessential limited-overs spinner early in his career. It was in Test cricket, though, that he became a force after he brought the full scope of his talents to bear on it. ",
            "His success was desperately needed by India in the time after Anil Kumble retired and Harbhajan Singh was on the wane. Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test, in which he was Player of the Match. In his first 16 Tests he collected nine five-fors, and he went on to be the fastest to 300 wickets and the second fastest to 400, behind only Muthiah Muralidaran.",
            "Among the highlights of Ashwin's Test career: 30 five-fors and counting, 90-odd wickets apiece against both Australia and England, and over 50 wickets a year four times. He reached his zenith in the 2016-17 home season, when he took 27 wickets in a three-Test series against New Zealand, 28 in five matches against England, six in a game against Bangladesh, and 21 against Australia in four Tests.",
            "Ashwin was picked by Chennai Super Kings in the IPL in 2009, and was one of the rare players who came into the public's reckoning through the IPL and proved himself good enough to have great success in Test cricket. He spent six seasons at CSK, winning the title twice, bowling at the top and the death, and coming on when wickets were required. He was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League in South Africa.",
            "He was part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but got few chances in that tournament ahead of Harbhajan. In the 2015 tournament, he made up with 13 wickets from eight games in India's run to the semi-final. In T20Is his finest hour was the World Cup in 2014, when he took 4 for 11 against Australia, and 11 wickets in all in the tournament, where India lost in the final.",
            "An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin has been a more than handy lower-order batter, correct, possessed of shots, and with five Test hundreds to his name.\n"

            "Brad Hodge will go down as one of the unluckiest nearly-men in Australian cricket. When he was dropped with an average of 58.42 only five matches into his Test career in 2005-06, he vowed to win back his place. He added only one Test, as a fill-in during a tour of the West Indies two years later, before his tally was permanently stalled at six matches in the baggy green. It was not an adequate reward for one of the most prolific run scorers in the modern era of Australia's domestic game.",
            "By the time the 2009-10 season arrived, Hodge's heart was no longer in first-class cricket. He began the summer with 195 against South Australia but had an epiphany when he had reached his century, stumps was near and he launched the new ball over the bowler's head for six. Hodge said it signified he no longer had the drive to play the longer format and he soon retired, although he announced he would stay on in Victoria's limited-overs teams for another two seasons. And why not? He comfortably topped the FR Cup tally in 2009-10 with 622 runs at 69.11, including four centuries, and remained one of the world's best Twenty20 batsmen.",
            "In 2006-07 he had forced his way into the ODI side when Ricky Ponting rested, and a 97 and 99 not out won him a place in the World Cup squad. In the Caribbean, he finally reached three figures with 123 off 89 balls against the Netherlands, but it was his last bat in the tournament and he watched the final from the dressing room. It had become an all-too familiar viewing platform. Hodge was Australia's unluckiest casualty of the 2005-06 season of batting change. Picked for his first Test in November after being the reserve on tours to India, New Zealand and England, he opened with a fluent 60 and by the end of the home summer had 409 runs at an envious average.",
            "Still it wasn't enough to earn a spot on the South Africa trip as the selectors returned to Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke. Included in his five outings was an unbeaten 203 against South Africa in Perth, where he joined his boyhood idol Dean Jones as one of five Australians to make their maiden century a double. Two Tests later, Hodge, a tiny right-hander who is more quiet and laid back than Jones, was dropped amid whispers of a technical flaw against fast bowling, a short drought in the Pura Cup and a selection \"judgment call\". He picked himself up with a century in the domestic final loss to Queensland but remained on the fringes of the national side, making occasional one-day and Twenty20 appearances. He held on to his Cricket Australia contract until 2009-10, but was never viewed by the selectors as anything but a back-up plan. ",
            "A regular and consistent performer for his state and counties, Hodge's Victorian debut came in 1993-94 as an 18-year-old and he almost compiled 1000 runs in the season as he settled quickly at No. 4. The following years were more difficult, but he returned from the dips as a more complete player, carrying a classical technique and the ability to direct shots to all parts of the ground. Around consistently impressive one-day returns, Hodge passed the 1000 barrier in the 2000-01 first-class summer when he was a key player in the Bushrangers' march to a second successive Pura Cup final. More of the same output was revealed in 2001-02, when he shared the domestic Player-of-the-Season award with Queensland's Jimmy Maher, and his consistency pushed him towards international honours. "

            "A century in The Hundred and a six-wicket haul on Test debut, all in the space of four months in 2022. Of the predictions made early on in Will Jacks' career, the former was far more predictable than the latter. ",
            "The tall, clean-hitting batter was always spoken of as a limited-overs destroyer, putting the wider cricketing public on notice when, in 2019, he shot to mainstream attention with a 25-ball hundred in a T10 pre-season match against Lancashire in Dubai. When he struck 108 not out from 48 deliveries for Oval Invincibles against defending champions Southern Brave, there was awe but not much surprise. ",
            "There was, however, when he became the first England debutant spinner since 1993 to claim a five-wicket haul, with 6 for 161 in the first innings of the first Test against Pakistan at Rawalpindi, setting up a famous win. It was also the first time he had taken more than four in a first class innings. All the more remarkable given he wasn't expected to play in that match, only coming in before the toss after Surrey teammate Ben Foakes fell ill. ",
            "His selection on that tour was primarily for his off spin, which, while still raw, had been fashioned into something worthwhile by Gareth Batty. Surrey's head coach had noticed similarities between Jacks and Moeen Ali - another allrounder whose spin bowling had to be coaxed out of him - and gave him the responsibility of being the lead spin threat during the 2022 County Championship season. Returns were modest - 17 dismissals at 47 - but, coupled with 648 runs at an average of 54 from 11 appearances, he blossomed as a key member of a title-winning side. ",
            "Earmarked for a long time as a star-in-waiting. After a ton against India in an Under-19 Test in the 2017 summer, he went to the Under-19 World Cup in 2018 as vice-captain, where he hit 102 against Canada but largely struggled elsewhere.",
            "Jacks was one of a clutch of Surrey young guns who advanced their reputation during their Championship-winning season in 2018. Jacks made his debut in all three formats, at 19, and made a significant impression with a maiden county century against Gloucestershire at The Oval in the One-Day Cup, including four sixes in his 121 off 100 balls."

            "An aggressive left-handed seamer, who bowls with as much venom as he bats, Wayne Parnell was earmarked for success early and spent the next few years trying to get there. Inconsistency and injury were his nemeses, however, and that led to him abandoning international cricket with South Africa and signing a three-year deal with Worcestershire as a Kolpak after the 2018 English season.",
            "Parnell signed immediately after becoming a member of the Worcestershire side that won the T20 Blast for the first time. He had played six Tests, 65 ODIs and 40 T20 matches for South Africa, but none since October 2017.",
            "Parnell was schooled at Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, the alma mater of Graeme and Peter Pollock, and began playing provincially when he was 12. He played at Under-13, Under-15 and Under-19 levels, and made his first-class debut for Eastern Province in 2006-07.",
            "He was part of South Africa's Under-19 squad for the 2006 World Cup in Sri Lanka and captained them in the 2008 edition in Malaysia. Parnell led by example, taking 18 wickets - the most in the tournament - and scored useful runs in the middle-order to steer South Africa to the final.",
            "Thereafter, he went on the Emerging Players tour of Australia before earning a call-up to the senior one-day squad for a series in early 2009. He had a modest debut against Australia, but later became the youngest player to be handed a national contract by Cricket South Africa, and soon repaid their faith. ",
            "At the 2009 World T20, Parnell snaffled nine wickets and had an economy rate of less than six. That included an impressive 4 for 13 against West Indies.   ",
            "After a successful county stint with Kent, Parnell made his Test debut against England in the fourth match at the Wanderers in January 2010. He played three Tests that year and earned a lucrative IPL contract when Delhi Daredevils splashed out US$ 610,000 on him. ",
            "A groin injury, however, ruled him out of the tournament. It would impact the next summer as Parnell was unable to tour Sri Lanka in August with the South Africa A side. But he recovered in time for the ODI series against Zimbabwe at home. Parnell played just one match in the 2011 World Cup and was also part of the 2012 World T20. He was not considered for the Champions Trophy the following year. ",
            "Instead, he was given an opportunity in Tests when he was included in South Africa's team to play a must-win match against Australia in Port Elizabeth in February 2014. Parnell announced his return with a wicket off his first ball and added another two deliveries later. He, however, bowled just eight more overs before leaving the field with another groin injury. ",
            "He recovered for the World T20 a month later and played in ODIs in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Parnell played just one match in South Africa's 2015 World Cup campaign, and didn't make it to their World T20 squad a year later."

He struggled to live up to those early expectations, played only 23 Tests, and in 2014 was banned for life by the ECB for breaching their anti-corruption regulations.   ",

            "In the early part of his career, though, Vincent was seen a fine batting talent. Following his outstanding Test debut in 2001-02, he wasn't always consistent, but came up with some top-class performances. A superb 224, his first Test double-century, against Sri Lanka was then followed up with a good one-day series in South Africa, in October 2005 and he returned home with his reputation intact, unlike many of his team-mates. The following season he signed for Worcestershire but he then had a disappointing Champions Trophy and was overlooked for the home Test and one-day series against Sri Lanka. ",
            "When his ODI return came, as a replacement for Nathan Astle in the tri-series in Australia in early 2007, Vincent grabbed the chance with both hands and strung together innings of 66, 76 and 90. It made him New Zealand's second-highest run-scorer for the tournament, despite playing only half the games and secured his ticket to the Caribbean. He began with two ducks before finding his form with a century against Canada, but a broken wrist ended his tournament before the Super Eight stage. ",
            "His career nosedived after a poor run of form during the tour of South Africa and the Chappell-Hadlee Series that followed. Dropped for the tour of Bangladesh, he admitted to suffering from depression and lost his contract with New Zealand Cricket after joining the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League. "

            "Irfan Khan Pathan was considered by many, with reason, as the most talented swing and seam bowler to emerge from India since Kapil Dev. Within a couple of years in international cricket, he was thought of as a possible successor to Kapil in the all-round department. There was talent to back the hype: cast your mind back to January 2006, when the lethal curve of his late swing consumed, off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of the Karachi Test, Salman Butt, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf; or to the previous Test in Faisalabad, where his 210-run partnership with MS Dhoni steered India past the follow-on mark.",
            "But a number of factors, not least the constant injuries that Kapil miraculously avoided, meant Irfan never really fulfilled his potential, and by his late 20s was more or less confined to bits-and-pieces roles in various IPL teams.",
            "Irfan was 19 when he made his Test debut in Australia, but already looked the part, bowling at a brisk pace and troubling quality batsmen with his left-arm swing. He played a big part in India's one-day and Test series wins on their revival tour of Pakistan in 2004.",
            "His batting soon took off and, under the management team of Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell, he was regularly pushed up the order in ODIs - with a promotion to No.3 immediately yielding a spectacular 83 against Sri Lanka in Nagpur. He was more than just a clean ball-striker, though, and his sensible, straight-bat approach often bailed India out of strife in Tests as well.",
            "But, either side of that Karachi hat-trick, his bowling form nosedived, with his pace dropping significantly, and he struggled to make both the Test and ODI teams by the time 2006 had ended. He was sent back from the tour of South Africa in 2006 to focus on domestic cricket. He made the 2007 World Cup squad but didn't figure in a single game during India's disappointing campaign, and was thereafter dropped from both the Test and ODI sides.",
            "Recalled for the inaugural World T20 in September 2007, Pathan did not disappoint, snapping up 10 wickets at 14.90. His crucial spell of 3 for 16 in the final against Pakistan earned him the Man-of-the-Match award.",
            "Irfan returned to the ODI side for the home series against Australia and Pakistan, and showed he had rediscovered his rhythm, based on which he was handed a recall in the third Test against Pakistan in Bangalore. He celebrated his comeback by making his first Test hundred. He was subsequently picked for the Test series in Australia, and came into the side for the third Test in Perth, where he played a crucial part in India's famous win - with five wickets and scores of 28 and 46 to claim the Man-of-the-Match award.",
            "Irfan lost his place in the India squad in 2009 and subsequently struggled with loss of form and injuries. A back injury forced him to spend eight months on the sidelines after the 2010 IPL, and he missed the entire domestic season. That did not stop him from being bought for $1.9 million by Delhi Daredevils at the 2011 IPL auction in January. After a mixed IPL season, he impressed during the 2011-12 Ranji Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker after four rounds of the tournament. His performances earned him a recall to the national side when he was picked for the final two ODIs against the West Indies in December, 2011. He came into his own during the one-day series in Sri Lanka in 2012, finishing as the highest wicket-taker and most economical bowler. He played the 2012 World T20 - also in Sri Lanka - and played all of India's games in the tournament, before injury struck once more."

            "M Vijay brings, along with his bat, pads and gloves, an invisible switch to the crease. When that switch is flicked on, given certain conditions, he can be one of the more pleasing sights in present-day cricket; when it is not, he can scratch and struggle on the flattest of pitches. He prefers to play off the front foot, which can bring his downfall, but it also produces some sensational hits down the ground, including the trademark pick-up shot over wide long-on.",
            "In his first few seasons of first-class cricket, Vijay became famous for converting starts into huge scores. One of those big scores came in a 462-run opening stand with Abhinav Mukund, which earned him a Test call-up in 2008-09 as replacement for Gautam Gambhir, who was serving a one-match ban for an on-field altercation. The Test opportunities remained limited, but the IPL provided him with another sphere of influence.",
            "However, the IPL also coincided with the drying up of huge scores. He kept scoring big in crucial IPL matches, but it seemed to have taken patience out of his game. There was a period of about four years during which he scored as many first-class centuries as in Twenty20s: two. It didn't help that he failed in the only full series he got as a Test opener, in the West Indies in 2011.",
            "When Vijay was finally given another full Test series, against Australia in 2012-13, it was a selectorial punt based more on potential than runs in domestic cricket. Vijay turned the punt into a jackpot, scoring back-to-back 150s, impressing with his improved back-foot play and the ability to buckle down and play time. The efforts against Australia took his tally of 150-plus scores to seven out of 13 first-class hundreds, and earned him an ODI recall for the 2013 Champions Trophy in England - though a poor run in the warm-up games meant he did not make the playing eleven in the tournament."

        "bio": [
            "A brutal left-handed opening batsman, Marcus Trescothick was one of the finest opening batsmen to play for England and also stood in as captain for two Tests and 10 ODIs.  He was an automatic choice from the turn of the century until a stress-related illness intervened with him not much past his 30th birthday and forced his international retirement in 2008. The anxiety attacks he suffered, particularly when having to contend with long periods away from home and family, brought the issue of depression and stress in sport into sharp focus in the English game and there was general delight when he continued his county career at Somerset where his genial biffing of county attacks brought much entertainment at Taunton and elsewhere. Somerset sought his services beyond his 40th birthday, confirming him as one of the great stalwarts of the English game in any era.",
            "Capacious of build and comfortable of movement, he had a benign air at the crease which meant that when he bullied attacks, which he did often, he bullied them gently. Not particularly mobile in the field, he turned himself into a safe slip fielder. He was a key factor in England's change in fortunes and, most notably, spearheaded an aggressive approach against Australia in the Ashes win of 2005. ",
            "There was something biblical about Trescothick's early career: seven years of plenty as a schoolboy, seven years of famine when he reached the Somerset 1st XI. And lo, it came to pass in 1999 that he batted on a pacey pitch at Taunton against Glamorgan while Duncan Fletcher was their coach, and made a storming 167, with five sixes, when the next-best score was 50. When England needed a stand-in one-day opener in 2000, Fletcher, by then elevated to the England job, remembered Trescothick. He took to international cricket immediately. A true opener, he formed a habit of starting a series well with a mixture of expert leaves, crisp cover-drives, spanking pulls and fearless slog-sweeps.",
            "Hefty, genial, and at ease on the big stage, Trescothick's first four England hundreds came in a losing cause, confirming his ability to keep his head while all around were losing theirs. Opening in Tests with Mike Atherton, Trescothick acquired the air of a senior player as if by osmosis - he joined the management committee on his first tour. All that stood between him and the highest level was a tendency to get out when well set, to make a breezy 20 or 30. He seemed to have conquered this with a domineering home season in 2002, but it reappeared - like so many English frailties - as soon as the team landed in Australia. Trescothick endured fluctuating fortunes over the next couple of seasons. He showed glimpses of his blazing best against South Africa in 2003, when he capped his season with a determined 219 (and 69 not out) in the astonishing series-levelling victory at The Oval, but his form slid away drastically in the Caribbean that winter.",
            "The selectors never lost faith with him and, having stood in as captain for the first Test of the 2004 season, Trescothick cracked a pair of hundreds against West Indies at Edgbaston. At Johannesburg in 2004-05, he set up England's series victory with a brutal 180 on the final morning, and carried his domineering form into the home season. Having bullied 345 runs in two innings against the Bangladeshis, he made 431 runs against Australia in a memorable summer of 2005, as he - and England - finally got the better of the one nation that really mattered. He cracked 90 in the second Test at Edgbaston, underlining that this England side was not lying down. It ignited the summer, a hope-laden innings from a player who was widely praised as the most selfless of cricketers.",
            "But his winter was cut short when he returned home suddenly from India under a cloak of secrecy, and after an indifferent summer it was announced he would miss the Champions Trophy as he was still recovering from a stress-related illness. He was included in the Ashes squad for the 2006-07 campaign Down Under but lasted less than two weeks before he was again boarding a flight back home with a recurrence of his illness.",
            "His return to action started with Somerset and his 2007 form, plus England's continued failings in one-day cricket, meant he was recalled to England's preliminary 30-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup. But he never made the cut, and, in March 2008, days after withdrawing at the last minute from Somerset's pre-season tour to the UAE - he was in an outlet of Dixons, the electrical store, when he decided he could not board the plane - he announced his retirement from international cricket. His candid autobiography, Coming Back to Me, was published in 2008, and told of his battle with the 'black wings' of depression.",
            "The book had a cathartic effect. In 2009 he enjoyed one of his most prolific seasons yet, scoring nearly 3,000 runs for Somerset in all competitions. He was named captain following Justin Langer's decision not to return for 2010 and even overcame his reservations to take part in the county's Champions League campaign in India that October, although he flew home after the group stages.",
            "Already enshrined in Somerset folklore, with a stand named in his honour, he nearly delivered the ultimate prize in 2010. His 1,397 runs at 58.20 helped Somerset enter the final day of the season knowing victory at Durham would be enough to win them their maiden County Championship. But time ran out on Somerset and Nottinghamshire achieved the bonus point they needed with three wickets after tea to snatch the title. Seemingly getting better with age, Trescothick plundered 1,673 runs in 2011 at a career-best season's average of 79.66. He also led Somerset to the finals of both the Friends Life t20 and Cyldesdale Bank 40, only to lose both. A year later, injury and poor weather resulted in a less-than-prolific season but, undeterred by his advancing years, Trescothick signed a new three year deal with Somerset in November 2012 but failed to score a century in any competition in 2013 - the first time in his career he has gone through a season without a three figure score. He recovered, in the first-class game at least, rattling up a formidable 1284 runs at 45.86 to help offset Somerset's relegation fears in 2015, including 210 not out in a vital late-season draw against Sussex at Hove.",
            "He must have felt as he passed his 40th birthday on Christmas Day that his chances of leading Somerset to that elusive Championship title had diminished. But he could not have imagined the agonising miss that befell Somerset in 2016 when they wrapped up a win in their final game at Taunton with a day to spare, went top of the table, but watched Middlesex and Yorkshire - both with title aspirations of their own - manufacture a positive result at Lord's. Trescothick had a wonderful personal season to look back on: 1,239 Championship runs and four more hundreds, capped by 218 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, an innings made on a stonkingly hot day which took him alongside Harold Gimblett as Somerset's most prolific century-maker in first-class cricket. He entered 2017 amid hopes in the West Country that the record would come his way at Taunton with the Quantocks shimmering in the haze and the chance to raise a glass to it with a post-match cider in the Ring of Bells. It duly arrived in May, bringing delight to an otherwise drab rain-affected draw against Warwickshire.",
            "By now, uncertainty over whether Trescothick would play on had become an annual ritual. In 2018, he broke his foot while turning awkwardly when batting against Lancashire at Old Trafford (on 95, he hobbled to a century), but retained the desire to recover before the end of the season and agree another year at his beloved Taunton.",
            "Time finally caught up with him in 2019. A barren spell saw him left-out of the Somerset team midway through the summer and, aged 43, he realised it was time to move on. Even before the end of the season, he became a familiar face at England training sessions as he made a smooth transition into the world of coaching."

Omission from the 2015 World Cup suggested his career was fading, but he was recalled a year later.",
            "Gul had played just nine first-class matches when called up for national duty in the wake of Pakistan's poor 2003 World Cup. On the flat tracks of Sharjah, Gul performed admirably, maintaining excellent discipline and getting appreciable outswing with the new ball.",
            "He isn't express but bowls a very quick heavy ball and his exceptional control and ability to extract seam movement marks him out. His first big moment in his career came in the Lahore Test against India in 2003-04. Unfazed by a daunting batting line-up, Gul tore through the Indian top order, moving the ball both ways off the seam at a sharp pace. His 5 for 31 in the first innings gave Pakistan the early initiative which they drove home to win the Test.",
            "Unfortunately, that was his last cricket of any kind for over a year as three stress fractures in his back were discovered immediately after the Test. The injury would have ended many an international career, but Gul returned, fitter and sharper than before in late 2005. He returned in a Pakistan shirt against India in the ODI series at home in February 2006 and in Sri Lanka showed further signs of rehabilitation by lasting both Tests but it was really the second half of 2006, where he fully came of age. Leading the attack against England and then the West Indies as Pakistan's main bowlers suffered injuries, Gul stood tall, finishing Pakistan's best bowler.",
            "In 2009 he put together a strong period of wicket-taking in ODIs, on dead pitches in Tests (including a career-best six-wicket haul against Sri Lanka) and established himself as the world's best T20 bowler, coming on after the initial overs and firing in yorkers on demand.",
            "He had hinted at that by being leading wicket-taker in the 2007 World T20; over the next two years he impressed wherever he went, in the IPL for the Kolkatta Knight Riders and in Australia's domestic T20 tournament. Confirmation came on the grandest stage: having poleaxed Australia in a T20I in Dubai with 4 for 8, he was the best bowler and leading wicket-taker as Pakistan won the second World T20 in England. The highlight was 5 for 6 against New Zealand, the highest quality exhibition of yorker bowling. "

Adept in any position in the batting order, Ontong is a fighting cricketer who can play pace and spin, a committed fielder and a handy spin bowler.",
            "Four years after making his first-class debut, Ontong got an opportunity to make his Test debut, in Sydney in January 2002, but the occasion was mired in controversy. Ontong was selected ahead of Jacques Rudolph for political reasons. It emerged that Percy Sonn, then the South Africa board president, had overruled the selectors and insisted on the inclusion of Ontong, a Cape Coloured, ahead of Rudolph, a white player. Rudolph and Ontong were room-mates at the time and have remained friends despite the circumstances of the tour.",
            "Scores of nine and 32 were all that Ontong managed in that match and it would be nearly three years before he earned another opportunity in Tests. He eventually returned to the squad for the trip to India in November 2004. However, the return was short-lived as he again failed to establish himself in a strong batting order and he had to wait until early 2008 for another recall when he was named to face West Indies. A strong 2008 domestic season, during which he was the Cobras' leading run-scorer, saw Ontong included for the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 in India in 2009 but he did not play a single game.",
            "Ontong returned to the domestic circuit and the fruits of maturity showed. In two first-class seasons in 2010-11 and 2011-12, he averaged over 50 in first-class cricket and in the latter season, over 70 in List A. He became a regular fixture in the South Africa A side and made a fourth return to national colours under the Gary Kirsten administration in January 2012."

",

Two years later came his first big outing, when he was one of three bowlers to take ten or more wickets at the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 for T&T.

He was among the chief architects of the side's two title victories, in 2012 and 2014, taking over 20 wickets apiece in both seasons. In the first half of his career with them, Narine was untouchable: in 2016, with more than 650 overs bowled for KKR, he had 216 wickets at an economy rate of 5.52. Such highs were beyond him in Test cricket, though. The last of his six matches for West Indies came in December 2013 and his bowling average in the format remains a dismal 40-plus.",

Before his ODI debut, in India in 2011, he needed to rework his action with the help of biomechanics experts at the University of Western Australia. In 2014 he missed out on playing the Champions League T20 final after being suspended for throwing. He withdrew himself from the ODI World Cup the following year, saying he needed to keep working on his action, but when he did return, he was suspended from bowling in international cricket after he was reported during a game against Sri Lanka in November 2015. He was cleared a few months later but missed the 2016 T20 World Cup. He was reported yet again during the PSL in 2018, cleared, then reported again in the 2020 IPL, and subsequently cleared once more.",
            "In the second half of the 2010s, attention was cast on quite another aspect of Narine's game - his batting. Melbourne Renegades sent him in as opener that BBL season, and he delivered, then taking on the role in other leagues as well. In 2017, he produced 502 runs at a strike rate of over 150 across five T20 leagues and in T20Is.\n"

Described by the national selector John Inverarity as \"one of the three or four best fieldsmen in Australia\", Coulter-Nile is an energetic presence on the field and adds explosive lower-order hitting to any side for which he plays. However, his international career has been stop-start since day one with serious back, hamstring and shoulder injuries repeatedly curtailing any attempt at an extended run in the international side. He fought back from a shoulder dislocation in late 2015 to play in the 2016 T20 World Cup and came back from two back injuries to make the 2019 World Cup squad. ",
            "He has been on the cusp of the Test side on a number of occasions but injury and Australia's strong fast bowling depth have prevented him from earning a baggy green and a back injury in 2017 meant he had to opt out of first-class cricket for the time being to aid his longevity in the limited overs formats.

Philippe's call-up came on the back of an outstanding Big Bash campaign for the Sydney Sixers where he was Man of the Match in the final and finished the tournament with three half-centuries in four innings. He is a wonderful timing of the ball with the full 360-degree range of shots, his power in display during the 2019-2020 BBL when he launched a six onto the roof of the pavilion at the SCG. ",
            "Philippe made his BBL for the Perth Scorchers before being snapped up by the Sixers and he continues to play his state cricket for Western Australia. He has shown his potential in the 50-over game, scoring runs at an impressive rate without yet converting into big scores although a quirk of his first 13 matches was that he had reached double figures every innings. There had also been a notable half-century for the Prime Minister's XI in 2018 against a strong South African attack featuring Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi. "

            "A strapping, genuine quick who regularly bowls in the 140-150kph range, Kagiso Rabada is the most exciting talent to emerge from South Africa in the post No.1 Test ranking era. Before he had turned 21, Rabada had already established himself as a potential leader of the attack. ",
            "Rabada thrust himself into the international spotlight at the 2014 Under-19 World Cup, where he took 6 for 25 against Australia in the semi-final. South Africa went on to win the title - their first - and Rabada finished as their highest wicket-taker.  ",
            "Three months later, he was awarded a franchise contract with Lions and before the year was up, he had been included in the national ODI and Test squads. He made his T20I debut against Australia in Adelaide in November 2014.  ",
            "In early 2015, Rabada showed his ability in the longer format. He claimed the South African record for the best bowling figures in a first-class match, 14 for 105, surpassing the haul taken by Dale Steyn seven seasons before. He finished the season as the third-highest wicket-taker in the Sunfoil Series. ",
            "He was included in all three squads to tour Bangladesh in July-August 2015, and became only the second player to take a hat-trick on ODI debut, eventually finishing with the best figures by a first-timer: 6 for 16. ",

On inhospitable pitches, he worked hard, often without reward but displayed the stamina required of a Test bowler. ",

But, despite bowling respectably on almost every outing, he had never quite made the breakthrough and an average of 63.75 made dispiriting reading. It looked as if he may be remembered as one of England's nearly men.",
            "But fate offered another chance. A knee injury to Ben Stokes saw Woakes recalled to the squad to play Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street. On the same day he claimed career-best figures of 9 for 36 against Durham - \"It was like facing 90mph legbreaks,\" Paul Collingwood said - and, with Alastair Cook insisting Woakes' batting gave him the edge (both Paul Farbrace and Trevor Bayliss wanted Jake Ball to play), he made it back into the XI.",
            "It was to prove the start of a golden summer. After career-bests to that point with bat and ball at Chester-le-Street, he made a maiden Test half-century at Lord's and followed it with an unbeaten 95 to help England to an unlikely tie in an ODI at Trent Bridge. It was the highest score by a No. 8 or lower in the history of ODIs and helped England recover from 92 for 6 in pursuit of 287.",
            "Then, at Lord's, he claimed 11 for 102 against Pakistan, becoming the first England bowler since Ian Botham in 1978 to take a five-wicket haul in each innings of a Test at the ground. He followed it with another seven wickets and a half-century in Manchester and five more wickets in Birmingham. His 26 wickets at 16.73 apiece were a record in a series between England and Pakistan. Woakes, finally, had arrived at the top level. He was named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for his efforts.",
            "In many ways it was a surprise it had taken so long. Woakes had long been a highly respected player at county level. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in 2006 as a 17-year-old and, before he was 20, was topping the county's bowling averages with impressive control and an ability to swing the ball both ways. Most of all, though, he impressed with an apparently unflappable temperament that Ashley Giles, director of cricket at Warwickshire, admitted he would like \"to clone\" as the template for all players.",
            "After two more solid county seasons, he was selected on the England Lions tour of the West Indies in 2010, where he performed admirably and was deemed ready for the next step. He made his international debut in a T20 in Adelaide in January 2011 and kept his cool to hit the winning runs in a thrilling one-wicket victory. A few weeks later, he claimed 6 for 45 at Brisbane - the second-best figures by an Englishman in ODIs. ",
            "Back in the UK, Woakes enjoyed another superb summer in first-class cricket with 56 wickets at 21.78 and 579 runs at 48.25. Most of his chances for England came with the white ball, playing sporadically over the next couple of years, before being handed a Test debut at the end of the 2013 Ashes. He performed respectably on a flat pitch, but it was felt he lacked the pace to prosper at Test level and he was left out of the Ashes squad for the return tour to Australia. ",
            "Having worked hard to add that pace, Woakes was recalled in place of Stokes in the summer of 2014 and played three Test in succession against India. He enjoyed no luck, but demonstrated the skill and control to suggest he had a future at that level. But a succession of injuries - and the development of Stokes - saw him slip back among the chasing pack and he lost his central contract at the end of 2015.",
            "The following summer changed his fortunes, and his growing reputation was rewarded in 2017 by a first IPL contract. But having been expected to lead England's attack in the Champions Trophy, he instead pulled up after bowling just two overs in their opening match and missed the rest of the tournament. A difficult Ashes tour followed and he was dropped from the Test side in New Zealand - his bowling average away from home having risen to 61.77 - but he bounced back during the English summer, scoring a maiden Test century, against India at Lord's."

            "- For one season, Pat Cummins held the record for the fastest fifty in IPL - jointly with KL Rahul - after he got to the mark in 14 balls when playing for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) against Mumbai Indians (MI) in 2022. Cummins' record was broken by Rajasthan Royals' (RR) Yashasvi Jaiswal in 2023 by one ball.",
            "- For a little under two hours, Cummins was the most expensive player procured at an IPL auction when he was sold to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) for INR 20.50 crore (US$2.47 million approx.) in the auction held a month after he had led Australia to the 2023 ODI World Cup title.",
            "- At the same auction, compatriot Mitchell Starc shattered the record when he attracted a winning bid of INR 24.75 crore (US$2.98 million approx.) from Cummins' former team, KKR.",
            "- Cummins went on to become the second Australian to lead SRH - after David Warner - despite never having captained any side in a senior T20 competition before.",
            "- He was the third Australian captain of an IPL team from Hyderabad. Both Adam Gilchrist, who led Deccan Chargers, and Warner delivered IPL titles before Cummins.",
            "Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances. By 2023 he had led the team to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup.",
            "Cummins burst onto the scene with a sensational Test debut, taking a match total of seven wickets to set up a thrilling two-wicket win to square the series against South Africa at the Wanderers. He had made his debut for New South Wales during the 2010-11 season and was particularly impressive in his maiden Big Bash season. Touted to be a future leader of Australia's pace attack, he was offered a central contract for 2011-12, becoming the youngest player to be contracted since the current system was introduced in 1998.",
            "Then came the injuries. He suffered repeated stress fractures in his lower back and did not play another Test for six years, until the 2017 tour of India. But all the pain and rehab of those intervening years appeared to have been worthwhile as his body toughened up to the rigours of international cricket.",
            "In the wake of Australia's ball-tampering scandal he became arguably the nation's shining light in a cricketing sense. He was absent through the various 2018 winter tours immediately after the controversy due to a back injury but was monumental in the losing home series against India and was subsequently rewarded with the Test vice-captaincy against Sri Lanka. He became the No. 1 ranked Test bowler in the world and claimed Australia's coveted Allan Border Medal as the 2018-19 men's cricketer of the year. He was immense during the 2019 Ashes in England and through another home series defeat against India in 2020-21, typified by a relentlessness with ball in hand and tremendous stamina.",
            "Having been identified as a future captain, his rise to the position came earlier than expected when Tim Paine resigned shortly before the 2021-22 Ashes. However, in a mark of the cricketer and leader Cummins had become it was, given the circumstances, almost a seamless transition. A few months later he had retained the Ashes and secured victory in Pakistan on Australia's first tour of the country in 24 years."

            "Michael Klinger has spent almost an entire career awaiting the Australia call that looked like it would never come. He has been mentioned in despatches more than once, but Australia have always opted for the younger, or the more fashionable, player. Through it all, Klinger has just kept scoring runs, and a call-up belatedly arrived at the age of 36 when he was named in Australia's T20 squad for a series against Sri Lanka in February 2017. A technically-correct top-order batsman with a penchant for the front foot, and who made his first-class debut in the 1990s, he has adapted to changing teams, formats and roles, and shown an aptitude for captaincy. ",
            "Klinger started in his home state of Victoria as a teenager but his progress was initially slow, and it took him five seasons to score his first hundred. A move to South Australia came in 2008-09 and it was such a successful change that in his first summer he piled up 1203 Sheffield Shield runs at 70.76, and was later handed the state's captaincy. He led the Redbacks to the 2010-11 Big Bash title and the 2011-12 Ryobi Cup, but in the Shield the team struggled and Johan Botha took over the leadership for 2012-13.",
            "A move further west came in 2014, when Klinger signed with Western Australia after being told by the Redbacks that his place in the side could not be guaranteed. Another thousand-run Shield season followed with the Warriors, second only to team-mate Adam Voges in the whole competition. But while a Test call-up came for Voges at 35, the similarly-aged Klinger received no such international attention, and had to settle for another productive season with Western Australia in 2015-16.",
            "Although his batting style would seem best suited to the long format, Klinger has proven an exceptional batsman in one-day and T20 cricket, where his correct strokeplay and good judgment of when to go aerial has been just as effective as the more adventurous batting of younger colleagues. He earned an IPL deal with Kochi Tuskers Kerala and in 2011 and at the time of his international T20 call-up, he was the all-time highest run scorer in BBL history. All of that was enough to persuade him to become a limited-overs specialist as he reached his mid-30s."

Function and efficiency win out over grace and style, but there is little doubting his methods have been effective and can be doubly so in future. ",
            "He has worked his way up diligently and steadily from Rawalpindi's junior ranks under the watchful gazes of Sabih Azhar and, later, Mansoor Rana, his national U19 coach. By the time he made his first-class debut in November 2007 expectations had already heightened: a patient 89 against a handy PIA attack did nothing to dampen them. Since then he has chipped away at whatever level and venue he has been given a chance in: U19 and A tours around the world and domestically. The results prompted a call-up into Pakistan's ODI side for the 2010 Asia Cup, though the suspicion remained that it was the wrong format: a Test debut in the Lord's Test soon after, however, seemed a more fitting reward.

            "Cameron Green was earmarked as an international cricket from very early. Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, he took 5 for 24 on first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WA's junior teams his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability. ",
            "Green didn't play any first-class cricket in 2017-18 and spent the 2018 winter at Cricket Australia's National Performance Centre in Brisbane. His game went to another level in 2019-20 after another stress fracture in his lower back forced him to stop bowling again. He made his maiden first-class century, producing scores of 87* and 121* to force an extraordinary draw against Queensland at the Gabba. He would score two more centuries that summer before posting a career-best 197 from 438 balls against New South Wales in October 2020. ",
            "That performance led to his first international call-up as he was named in Australia's ODI and T20I squads to face a touring India side which was followed by a Test debut against the same opposition. He made half-centuries in each of his first four series then claimed a maiden five-wicket haul against South Africa the MCG in late 2022 - during a game where he badly broke his finger. Shortly after returning to side in India he made a maiden Test hundred in Ahmedabad.",
            "By then, his cross-format skills had caught the eye after a pair of dazzling T20I fifties in India led to a bidding war in the 2022 IPL auction where Green fetched AU$3.15million from Mumbai Indians and he went on to flay a memorable 47-ball century in the 2023 tournament."

His unbeaten 130 against West Indies in Dominica also ensured that he would be part of Australia's starting XI for the 2015 Ashes series that followed, and although he struggled for impact in the first three Tests, he managed a pair of fifties towards the end of Australia's unsuccessful campaign. ",
            "Not only did Voges retain the faith of the selectors, after the post-Ashes retirements of Michael Clarke, Chris Rogers, Shane Watson and Brad Haddin, he was even made vice-captain to Steven Smith for the Test tour of Bangladesh in the absence of the newly-appointed vice-captain David Warner due to injury. Security concerns led to that series being postponed, but Voges made up for the lost opportunity by scoring 269*, 106* and 239 in three innings against West Indies and New Zealand in the 2015-16 season. He retired from international cricket on Valentine's Day 2017 - with an average of 61.87, the second highest for anyone after Donald Bradman among those to have played 20 matches - and then from domestic cricket a month later. ",
            "Voges' promotion to the Test side came after a remarkable 2014-15 season in which he plundered 1358 runs at 104.46 in the Sheffield Shield, including six centuries from 11 matches. His numbers were so impressive that the selectors could not ignore him for the tour of the West Indies in 2015, nearly nine years after he had first been part of an Australian Test squad. In 2006-07 he was a surprise inclusion after the mid-Ashes retirement of Damien Martyn, but Voges did not debut during that series and until his mid-30s had to settle for being an ODI and T20 international cricketer. Even in those formats he was never really a fixture in the side, although there might have been a few more appearances had he not chosen to get married rather than joining Australia on their tour of South Africa in 2009. As it happened, it took him more than six years to reach 30 one-day internationals, despite averaging in the mid- to high-40s when given the chance. "

            "Sometimes first impressions can prove unerringly accurate. On his second XI debut for Warwickshire in 2002, effectively a trial game, Jonathan Trott scored a dominant 245 that suggested the arrival of a special talent. It was, after all, the highest score by a debutant in the history of Second XI Championship cricket and convinced Warwickshire to sign Trott, unlike Kevin Pietersen in a similar situation three years earlier. But not Trott. He smashed his bat in frustration after his dismissal. This was a man whose hunger for runs would not be easily sated.",
            "Starting well was a theme of Trott's career. In 2003 he made a century on first-class debut as an opener for Warwickshire against a strong Sussex attack - he was 96 not out at lunch - and in 2009 he made a century on Test debut at The Oval. To have played such a significant part in England winning an Ashes decider earned his reputation as a technically correct, temperamentally sound top-order batsman. Though less glorious tours of South Africa and Bangladesh followed, Trott sealed his reputation with a double-century against Bangladesh at Lord's and a masterful 184 against a Pakistan side at the same ground. Though the match was later tarnished by spot-fixing revelations, Trott later said he considered the innings his best as he defied Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif and helped rescue England from 102 for 7.",
            "Trott went on to play a key part in England retaining the Ashes in Australia in 2010-11 - the first time they had won a Test series there in nearly a quarter of a century - with centuries at Adelaide and Melbourne and the defeat of India in England the following summer to assume the No.1 Test ranking. His standing as the finest No. 3 England had possessed for many years was confirmed. Despite a relatively lean 2012, during which he averaged 38.65, Trott's remarkable consistency was demonstrated by a run at the start of the following year, when his lowest score in 17 consecutive Test and ODI innings was 27, with two hundreds and six half-centuries.",
            "Born in Cape Town to a British father and South African mother, Trott played for the South Africa side from Under-15 to Under-19 level, graduating into the Boland and then the Western Province teams. His future in the South Africa side looked assured. But Trott, never easily satisfied, wanted more. Bored by further education - he admits he had to look at the blackboard to even spell the subject during the psychology portion of his exam in the Human Movement Science degree he abandoned at Stellenbosch University - he took advantage of his British passport and his relationship with Bob Woolmer, who coached South Africa and Warwickshire, to arrange a trail in England. He soon embraced the club and country with a passion, marrying the granddaughter of former club captain HE \"Tom\" Dollery and insisting he felt \"completely British\" and that he preferred Birmingham to Cape Town.",

In 2007, in the middle of Mark Greatbatch's unhappy period as director of cricket at Edgbaston, Trott endured a chronic loss of form that saw him average only 22 and Warwickshire suffer relegation in both first-class and List A formats. Oddly, he made his international debut that season having been called into the England T20I team. After breaking his hand in the nets prior to the match, it was one of the few times he made an underwhelming debut. ",
            "Despite setting a record in 2009 for the most runs in an English domestic T20 season of 10 matches, some have never accepted his value as a limited-overs player, either. While Trott's ODI average in excess of 50 is substantially higher than any regular England player in ODI history, his strike-rate of around 75 was a source of constant discussion - never more so than during the 2013 Champions Trophy, when the make-up of England's top three was questioned. The records showed, however, that when Trott flourishes, England flourished too, and he was their leading run-scorer as they narrowly failed to win the competition.",
            "His presence at the crease had arguably become the most reassuring sight in English cricket since the retirement of Graham Gooch. His prolonged marking of his guard was as near as cricket got to a national talking point. But when he abruptly left England's 2013-14 Ashes tour after the first Test in Brisbane with a stress-related illness, England's director of cricket, Andy Flower, bemoaned the loss of his \"rock\".",
            "An early attempt at a comeback at the start of the 2014 season had to be aborted after it transpired there would be no quick fix to his problems and a discomfort against the short ball became more apparent. But, after a break, he returned strongly towards the end of the season, ending the Royal London One-Day campaign as the highest England-qualified run-scorer and helping Warwickshire to second place in the Championship. It was enough to win him a recall to the Lions squad for the tour of South Africa and, following a double-century there, a Test recall in the Caribbean."

            "One of the great limited-overs bowlers in his pomp, Lasith Malinga gained a reputation for delivering searing inswinging yorkers from a round-arm action as destructive as it was distinctive. That yorker, a deceptive slower ball, and an excellent bouncer formed the body of Malinga's menace, while the action made his deliveries hard to pick up. All that ability was also set off by street smarts; Malinga was rarely shy to switch up plans, and reshuffle fields. Even when batsmen thought they knew what was about to come, Malinga retained the capacity to surprise.",
            "Found in his teens playing soft-ball cricket on the beaches of Rathgama, just north of Galle, Malinga became one of the poster boys for the informal Sri Lankan coaching system and its philosophy of equipping unconventional bowlers, rather than remaking them. Malinga has repeatedly credited Champaka Ramanayake for his success. It was Ramanayake who initially took interest in him, and with whom he developed the yorker that became the foundation of his career. The coach would glue a pair of shoes near the popping crease. Malinga would spend hours bowling at them. ",
            "Initially picked for his pace, Malinga toured Australia with the Sri Lanka team in 2004, where he claimed 6 for 90 in a tour match and went on to make his Test debut - he dismissed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over, in Darwin. During an impressive tour of New Zealand the following year, his low-slung action resulted in the New Zealand batsmen asking the umpire to change the colour of their trousers as the ball was getting lost.",
            "But it was in the shorter formats that destiny beckoned Malinga. He became the first - and, so far, only - bowler to claim four wickets in four balls, when he took Sri Lanka to the brink of victory against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup. He has two more ODI hat-tricks - against Australia and Kenya - and he quickly established himself as Sri Lanka's limited-overs spearhead. Though Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan also played important roles, Malinga was arguably the single-most important player in Sri Lanka's excellent run in global tournaments from 2007-2014.",
            "It is felt Malinga never realised his full potential in Tests, though perhaps through no fault of his own. He was only the third player to reach 100 Test wickets for Sri Lanka but a knee injury in 2008 laid him low for two years. He was picked again for Muttiah Muralitharan's farewell series, but again found himself injured for a period of some months. In April 2011, at the age of 27, Malinga announced his Test retirement, citing the desire to manage his \"chronic knee injury\" and extend his limited-overs career. It is thought his unique bowling action places a substantial load on the joints in his hips and legs. However, the fact that he announced his retirement while playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL rankled at home. Through the forthcoming years, Malinga would go on to have a complicated relationship with Sri Lankan fans and media. In that time, he also became one of the IPL's iconic figures, representing Mumbai throughout.",
            "Malinga's finest moment came during the 2014 World T20, in which he nominally captained the side through the knockouts but, more importantly, delivered a clinical final spell to muzzle the India middle order. Sri Lanka would go on to win that title but, before long, Malinga's career became threatened by fitness issues - both involuntary and self-inflicted. In late 2014, a long-standing ankle complaint deteriorated to the extent that it required surgery. Malinga was a diminished force through the 2015 World Cup and became significantly slower in his later years, in which he also put on weight. "

Morris is a bowling allrounder, who often sends the speedgun beyond 140kph and bats fearlessly in the lower-order. He is also a handy slip-fielder, and in that regard, he takes after his father, former Northern Transvaal first-class cricketer Willie. ",
            "Morris was a late bloomer, who made his first-class debut at 22 and only came to the attention of the national selectors when he was well into his mid-20s. He finished the 2011-12 season as the leading wicket-taker in the domestic T20 competition, with 21 scalps at 12.66 and was picked to play a T20 tri-series in Zimbabwe. ",
            "Later that year, he showed his skills for his franchise, the Lions, in the 2012 Champions League. Morris combined with the likes of Sohail Tanvir and Dirk Nannes to provide a powerful seam attack and take the team to final of the competition. On the basis of that tournament, he was one of the big buys of IPL and went to Chennai Super Kings for more than 31 times his base price of US$20,000",
            "Despite his T20 fame, Morris insisted he was not a limited-overs specialist and the numbers backed him up. Morris had a promising 2010-11 first-class season, when he averaged over 60 with the bat, albeit in the provincial, not franchise division, in South Africa. He also led the Lions' charge in the 2012-13 Sunfoil Series and finished with 32 wickets at 16.00 and three years later was rewarded with a Test call-up. ",
            "In the 2015-16 summer, with South Africa's bowling reserves depleted by injury, Morris debuted at the New Year's Test against England. He made more of an impression as a batsman with 69 in his first match and he took that form into limited-overs' cricket as well. "

Peshawar Zalmi head coach Mohammad Akram had been monitoring this process at the domestic circuit and snapped him form the emerging category in Pakistan Super League.",
            "Hasan made a smooth transition to international cricket, grabbing two five-fors in his first 15 ODIs and impressing with his tight lines on his Test debut - which coincided with the farewells of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan - as Pakistan pulled off a last-gasp win in Dominica. Still, no one could quite imagine the impact he would have on his first global tournament, the 2017 Champions Trophy."

Though he's tall and muscular, Ashraf bowls military medium pace and relies upon seam movement and nagging accuracy to tie batsmen down. He can prove very difficult to get away in short-format cricket, especially with the wicketkeeper up to the stumps, but he's also enjoyed success in the Intercontinental Cup. His 4 for 24 helped Afghanistan to a one-wicket win over Netherlands on his first class debut in 2009, and he's generally kept things very tidy since then."

Thereafter, he got his first international break in 2004, when he made his ODI debut against Bangladesh, while the Test debut followed early in 2006. However, he truly made his mark as an international player only in his second coming, when he returned to the Test side in 2013 after a three-year absence.",
            "Selected to open the innings in the three-Test home series against England, Fulton was prolific, scoring centuries in each innings in the third Test in Auckland. Before that game, Fulton's highest in 19 Test innings had been 75. The series against England re-established Fulton's credentials as a Test player and showed that he could yet live up to his early potential.",
            "Fulton, who has played a lot of club cricket in England, is a product of Canterbury Country, an area rich in cricket history but which had never previously produced an international player. When he first broke into the New Zealand set-up, in 2004-05, he was seen as one for the future. In the ODI series at home against Sri Lanka in 2005-06, scores of 70 not out, 32, 50 and 112 led to a Test baptism: he added 75 in his second match, as New Zealand took an unbeatable lead over West Indies. At the time, John Bracewell, New Zealand's coach, believed he has the tools to open, although he had problems there against South Africa early in 2006. "

            "A skilled wicketkeeper standing back, pugnacious batsman in the traditional keeping spot of No. 7 and a stout upholder of the team ethic, Matt Prior was a crucial cog in the machine that led England up the Test rankings. He cut a similar figure to Alec Stewart with his no-nonsense positivity, even if he did not quite possess the same fastidious attention towards his appearance.",
            "Prior's reputation reached its peak after England's tour of New Zealand in 2013. He saved the final Test in Auckland, and the series, with a defiant, out-of-character century - batting for four-and-a-half hours for an unbeaten 110, an innings which epitomised England's spirit. He won England's Player of the Year award and his ability to rouse the mood with Churchillian speeches led him to be named as vice captain for the Ashes tour to Australia in 2013-14. But back-to-back Ashes tours treated him unkindly, bringing a marked slump in his form and his keeping standards and he made only one fifty in eight Tests; even that, a counterattacking affair in Perth with the game lost, had an air of desperation. He was dropped for Jonny Bairstow for the final two Tests in Australia and, although he still possessed a Test average above 40, began the 2014 county season with Sussex with his Test spot seriously in question.",
            "He was patched up for the first four Tests of the summer - two against Sri Lanka and two against India - but his long-standing Achilles problems severely hampered his wicketkeeping and a subsequent operation revealed such damage that it was amazing he had even taken the field. The last thing he needed was for his commitment to the cause to be demeaned so savagely at the end of the season in Kevin Pietersen's autobiography. He admitted that he was not entirely sure his first-class career could be salvaged and, with an eye to the future, committed his energies to forming a cycling team. With hindsight, it proved a shrewd move and he announced his injury-induced retirement in June 2015.",
            "Prior moved to England from South Africa and represented England at all ages, up to and including Under-19s, making his Sussex debut in 2001 as a 19-year-old. He was selected to tour Zimbabwe as part of England's one-day squad in November 2004 and played in just one match, striking 35. He made England's winter squads for Pakistan and India in 2005-06, but played mostly as a batsman in the ODIs and failed to make any real impact. He missed out on the Champions Trophy in October 2006 but was named in the Academy squad to be stationed in Perth during the 2006-07 Ashes series. ",
            "Geraint Jones and Chris Read flunked their chances during England's shambolic Ashes campaign, which meant Prior was ready to step into the Test side and launch Peter Moores' period at the helm. He began in thrilling fashion, becoming the first England wicketkeeper to score a century on debut with an unbeaten 126 at Lord's, followed by 75 at Headingley, and England's wicketkeeper problem looked settled. But no sooner was the position sorted than things started going awry. He struggled against India and was a key protagonist in the jellybean fiasco that goaded Zaheer Khan to bowl out England at Trent Bridge before a grim tour to Sri Lanka exposed deep flaws in his keeping. Some misplaced levels of sledging also did not endear him to everybody and he was dropped for England's tour of New Zealand in 2008, with his old Sussex rival, Tim Ambrose - now at Warwickshire - taking the gloves. ",
            "But Prior's extra batting class could not be ignored for long, and he returned to the side before the year was out, with his keeping vastly improved during his spell on the outside. He was one of the unsung heroes of England's Ashes triumph in 2009, providing momentum-shifting cameos at No. 6 in the order, and pulling off a series of impressive catches and stumpings. He bettered that effort on the subsequent tour of Australia in 2010-11, claiming 23 catches in the series including an Ashes-record-equalling six in the first innings at Melbourne, and concluded the series with his first hundred against Australia, at Sydney. He made 271 runs at 67.75 during England's 4-0 home triumph against India the following summer as both he and England, who went to No. 1 in the Test rankings, reached a career high.  Fielders standing around point were likely to be under assault if a bowler gave him any width outside off stump. At that juncture he was among several contenders as the most effective wicketkeeper-batsman in Test cricket. "

The leg spin that removed South Africa's Graeme Smith with his first ball in international cricket - his only England wicket at the time of his recall - had matured, too: 57 wickets in the three competitions in 2018, a part-timer no longer. The anecdote that his former Kent captain, Rob Key, would never bowl him because he thought he was just a bored batsman in the field, was gleefully told all summer.",
            "So, after an absence of eight-and-a-half years, Denly made his international return in a T20I in Sri Lanka. He claimed career-best T20 bowling figures (and the player of the match award) of 4-19, too, following with a Test debut - aged 32, he was the oldest specialist batsman to make a Test debut for England in nearly 25-years - in the Caribbean three months later. ",
            "And while he was not entirely convincing - he came within a whisker of suffering a pair on debut, benefiting from a dropped chance in the second innings and the tightest of umpiring decisions in the first - he underlined his versatility by opening the batting on debut and making 69 in his second Test  from No. 3 to ensure his name remained in the frame for future selection.",
            "So while he missed out on World Cup selection - he never looked a comfortable fit for the role of spinning all-rounder which Ed Smith, the national selector and very much a Denly champion, insisted he could fulfil - he retained his place in the Test side for the 2019 Ashes.",
            "And while he struggled with the pace of an excellent Australian attack, he demonstrated admirable bravery and resilience in defying them at times. He made three half-centuries in the final three Tests, returning to the top of the order for the final two and falling agonisingly short of a maiden century (he made 94) at The Oval.",
            "He first played international cricket in 2009. But though he had his moments, he looked vulnerable to the ball nipping back and was eclipsed by the emergence of Craig Kieswetter. ",
            "For eight years, those international ambitions seemed lost, a move from Kent to Middlesex failing to reignite his career, and in 2015 he returned to the county of his birth with considerable success. Remarkably, considering that Canterbury has been the county headquarters since 1870, Denly was held by the county's website to be the first capped player to be born in the town. Many words could be spent analysing the message that carried. ",
            "A product of the Kent youth system, having been with the county since the age of 13, Denly made his debut in 2004 against Oxford University. He served notice of his considerable talent with three half centuries in three Under-19s Tests whilst touring India with England in 2005. He captained both Kent 2nd XI and the ECB Development of Excellence XI team, and scored his maiden first-class hundred against Cambridge University in 2006. Then the release of David Fulton opened up a place in the Kent top order, which Denly took with both hands during the first part of the 2007 season. His prolific form caught the eye of England's selectors and he was named in the England Lions side to face India.",
            "The 2008 summer again kept him in the frame, especially in one-day cricket, where he enjoyed an impressive T20 tournament. But it was in 2009, after averaging 51.85 in the Friends Provident Trophy, that Denly got his international call-up. He had his moments opening the batting, making half-centuries against Ireland and Australia and averaging 29.77 in nine ODIs. But he struggled for consistency, looking particularly vulnerable to the ball coming back into him, and, like many before him, then suffered a lengthy domestic slump after being dropped from the international side. ",
            "At one stage he went nearly two years without a Championship hundred. Sensing a need to revive his career he left Kent at the end of 2011 and moved to Middlesex. But his form continued to be patchy, and in 2014 he regularly found himself left out of the side, as he averaged just 23.35 in the Championship. In three seasons at Lord's, Denly hit only two centuries in all formats of the game. After he was released, he opted to return to Kent to try and reinvigorate his career, hoping to rekindle a highly effective partnership with Key, preparing for the challenge by playing domestic cricket for Brother Union in Bangladesh. ",
            "Denly's return to Kent was a satisfying one as he became one of only two Kent players to hit 1,000 Championship runs. That consistency was sadly lacking the following summer, although he did have a career-best 206 not out against Northants in May to sustain him and also won further attention in the following Championship game when he put family ahead of profession when he abandoned an innings against Derbyshire in Derby overnight to be at the birth of his first child."

            "Spin bowlers of genuine potential are a rarity in South Africa, much less the jewels who can hold a bat as well as field with attacking intent. Peterson, a left-arm finger spinner from Eastern Province, fills all three vacancies more than competently. At first glance he seems an overly orthodox slow bowler, but he turns the ball appreciably given help from the pitch and is invariably a tidy operator with a steadily developing understanding of flight. Peterson has also cultivated an unusual delivery that turns into the right-handed batsmen.He was part of the South African Under-19 team that took on Pakistan and England, and he played the Under-19 World Cup in 1998. Peterson made his Test debut in 2003 against Bangladesh, taking five wickets and scored 61. It was in Bangladesh where he took his first five-wicket haul as well, on the 2008 tour.",
            "Given more chances in ODIs, Peterson eventually began to grab his opportunities and his bowling, in particular, developed very usefully. He was part of South Africa's squad at the 2007 World Cup and hit the winning boundary - an outside edge past slip - in South Africa's one-wicket victory over Sri Lanka at Providence. He slipped out of national contention for a time, and didn't play for South Africa again for two years, but in the meantime represented the Warriors with distinction. In April 2009 he moved to Cape Town and, despite having a year remaining on his Warriors contract, requested a transfer to the Cape Cobras because his partner wanted to pursue her career in the Western Cape.

Born in Middlesex to Sri Lankan parents, but brought up in Perth, Western Australia, Mascarenhas returned to these shores in 1996 to play for Hampshire, making an immediate impact by taking 6 for 88 against Glamorgan on debut. At his most effective in one-day cricket, he has made a habit of producing big performances in vital games, including a Man of the Match performance in the 1998 NatWest trophy semi-final when he took 3 for 28 and scored 73. He also featured in Hampshire's victorious C&G campaign in 2005. He scored the first century at the Rose Bowl, against Worcestershire in 2001, and also took the first hat-trick recorded in Twenty20 cricket, amongst his 5 for 14 against Sussex at Hove in 2004.",
            " A regular in England's Hong Kong sixes team, it is his allround pedigree - he is an excellent fielder - which has made him so effective in domestic one-day cricket. After being awarded a benefit year by his club in 2007, he was given his chance to shine for England when called up to their one-day squad in June. It was a long overdue selection as Hampshire supporters will attest to, but Mascarenhas made his chance count, slapping five sixes in a single over from Yuvraj Singh at The Oval, and earning a call-up to England's Twenty20 squad on the back of some disciplined bowling performances. His growing reputation in the shorter forms of the game saw him as the first England player to join the Indian Premier League, in 2009, and later that year he captained Hampshire to a Friends Provident Trophy triumph at Lord's, where Sussex were beaten in the final."

            "No contemporary cricketer, Tendulkar aside, made batting look so simple as Damien Martyn. But it was not always thus. For the brash 21-year-old who waltzed into the Australian team at Dean Jones's expense, batting was an exercise in extravagance. To defend was to display weakness - a policy that backfired in 1993-94 when Martyn's airy square-drive at a crucial moment in Sydney triggered a five-run defeat by South Africa and a six-year hitch to his own promising career. By the time Western Australia, wanting a pretty face to spearhead their marketing campaign, had made him captain at 23, Martyn looked a tormented man. All the more remarkable, then, that he blossomed into a relaxed, classical, feathery artist. He was an elastic fieldsman and an old-style batsman whose first movement was back. He played with a high elbow, a still head, a golfer's deft touch, and had all the shots, including perhaps the most brutal reverse-sweep in the game. ",
            "Mostly, though, Martyn stuck to the textbook and composed pristine hundreds which, like the feats of the best wicketkeepers, passed almost unnoticed: an observation supported by the curious fact that, despite a Test average in the fifties, he reached the age of 30 without winning a Man-of-the-Match award. He was the quiet man of the 2003 World Cup-raising side, too, playing a minor role until he spanked 88 not out in the final - with a broken finger that later kept him out of a West Indian tour. His magnificent 13-month streak of 1608 Test runs at 61 and two Man-of-the-Series prizes from March 2004 finally moved him from the dressing-room shadows to the more uncomfortable limelight. Showing his hard-earned versatility, he crafted seven centuries on surfaces ranging from raging turners in Sri Lanka and India to green seamers in New Zealand and the hard bounce of home. ",
            "The flood ended in England and following a series of 178 runs and a couple of horrid umpiring decisions he was the major casualty of the Ashes loss. Retaining a one-day spot, he expected his five-day days were over - \"If that's my last Test match, well, I've had a great time\" - but was reprieved when the selectors wanted experience for the South Africa tour. As the decision to ignore policy by looking back to a 34 year old became increasingly doubtful, Martyn repaid with a nerveless 101 that led to victory in the final Test. After being a key part in Australia's first Champions Trophy success, he struggled in the opening two Tests of the Ashes series and swiftly retired. "

But that hasn't changed the fact that Imrul has always had a tough time holding down his place in the Bangladesh side. In fact, in his first ten years in international cricket, he has missed more ODIs than he has played, and despite being more consistent than many of Tamim's partners, he has been easily dropped in Tests too.",

            "Whatever innocent impression might initially be given by his blond hair and baby-faced good looks, there have been few feistier cricketers in England's Test history than Stuart Broad. His new-ball partnership with James Anderson has sustained England's Test attack for years, his own aggression and ability to flog bounce from all but the most benign surface dovetailing nicely with Anderson's technical excellence. And as Anderson continued to set new landmarks, Broad followed ably in his slipstream, emulating his friend when becoming only the second Englishman to take 400 Test wickets.",
            "Broad has been blessed with one remarkable career performance. However long he plays, surely nothing will come close to the first session of the Ashes Test of 2015, on his home ground of Trent Bridge, when he took 8 for 15 as Australia were bowled out before lunch, in only 18.3 overs, for 60. This was Australia's ultimate humiliation - a beating as raw and ridiculed as the 5-0 larruping from 18 months earlier that England were on their way avenging. Broad's incredulous hands-to-mouth expression as Ben Stokes plucked a catch at fifth slip became the picture of the summer.",
            "Broad has always been a bowler capable of a hot streak. On the occasion of his 100th Test in November 2016, he had taken five wickets in a single spell seven times. On such occasions, he runs in hard and his menace visibly grows. His combative fast bowling and volatile temperament (comparisons have been made with Draco Malfoy, a Harry Potter baddie) has been one of his great strengths as well as periodically bringing criticism about his behaviour, but the respect in which he is held was amplified when England recognised his desire to succeed and ability to think on his feet by appointing him as Twenty20 captain. He led the side on 27 occasions between 2011-15 before England, with an eye to the preservation of a vital player, utilised him increasingly as a Test specialist.",
            "Despite being carted for six sixes in an over by Yuvraj Singh at the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007, his stock continued to rise on tour with England in Sri Lanka when his 11 cheap wickets helped them to a 3-2 one-day series victory. He was then called up for the subsequent Test series, making his debut on a slab of Colombo concrete and toiling for 36 sweaty overs. The subsequent tour of New Zealand proved to be his real chance, however. With Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison both lacking form, he was selected for the Wellington Test. The decision taken by his coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan was soon vindicated.  ",
            "Broad was already shaping up as the Next Big Thing of English cricket when he pushed his career into overdrive in a sensational spell of bowling in the fifth and decisive Ashes Test at The Oval in 2009. With the series in the balance, Broad claimed figures of 5 for 37 in 12 overs, including 4 for 8 in 21 balls, and after that there was no coming back for Australia.",
            "He was struck by injury for the first time in the 2010-11 winter, ruled out of the last three Ashes Tests before breaking down again during the World Cup. However, his significance in England's future was confirmed when he was named Twenty20 captain. A slump in form almost cost him his Test place for the visit of India - a period when he was misguidedly imagined in the \"enforcer\" role - but, having survived the cut, he responded with a Man-of-the-Series display, including the first Test match hat-trick to be recorded at Trent Bridge, in a spell of 5 for 5: another trademark burst.",
            "Broad's form with the ball was one of the few positives as England suffered a 3-0 whitewash against Pakistan in February 2012 and he began the domestic Test season in splendid form, against West Indies at Lord's, taking 7 for 72 in the first innings, which made him only the eighth player to earn the distinction of being on two honours boards at the home of cricket. His four in the second innings made him the first England bowler to take 10 wickets or more in a match there since Ian Botham in 1978.",
            "His subsequent form was less impressive, however. Concerns that he was dropping in pace were alleviated by eight wickets against South Africa at Headingley, but he lost his place on the tour of India, after struggling with a heel injury and failing to take a wicket in either of the first two Tests. But after being fitted with specially designed boots, he showed signs of improvement.",
            "That recovery was confirmed against New Zealand at Lord's, as he ripped out 7 for 44 - his best Test figures - and he then almost single-handedly won the Durham Test against Australia with another 11-wicket haul (six in one inspired spell), as England secured their third Ashes series in a row. There was a six-for in the first innings at Brisbane, as England began the return tour in 2013-14 well enough - only to end up being whitewashed for the third time in Ashes history.",
            "Broad's growing maturity was never more evident. He went to Australia as a marked man, after his butter-wouldn't-melt failure to walk at Trent Bridge the previous summer, his nick against Ashton Agar looking all the worse because the ball cannoned off the gloves of wicketkeeper Brad Haddin to first slip. Broad had to withstand a self-righteous debate about \"walking\", a practice which had largely died out for half a century, and he was roundly booed by Australian crowds throughout the winter, but he softened their hostility by good-naturedly soaking up all they threw at him, as well as producing some of England's best spells, and emerging as their leading wicket-taker, on a forgettable tour.",
            "He was too hostile for India again at Old Trafford in 2014, returned his Ashes eight-for the following year, then treated South Africa to a concerted assault in Johannesburg in 2015-16. Broad's latest five-wicket spell was his first overseas and brought a decisive end to South Africa's proud stint as the world No.1 Test side. When he claimed his 400th Test wicket in Auckland in 2018, he was the youngest man to reach the mark.",
            "His batting has flattered to deceive. In 2008, no less a technical purist than Geoffrey Boycott likened his tall elegant batting style to Sir Garfield Sobers, but predictions that he would develop into a fully-fledged allrounder did not come to pass. Nevertheless, he has a remarkable Test hundred against his name, his stand-and-deliver assault on the Pakistan attack at Lord's in 2010, from 102 for 7, bringing him 169 - the highest score by an England No. 9. The Test was later sullied by revelations that Pakistan had bowled deliberate no-balls, bringing lengthy bans for three of their players.",
            "In his early cricketing career, Broad played as an opening batsman, following the example of his father, Chris, until he suddenly shot up. Within 18 months he had transformed himself into a beanpole medium-fast bowler, gaining international recognition with the England Under-19 side and establishing himself in the Leicestershire first XI in 2005, beginning a meteoric rise that included an England A debut in only his 11th first-class match in March 2006 and a call-up to the senior one-day side five months later."

            "Daniel Christian has become a global T20 gun-for-hire after spending most of his career in and around the Australia team without really earning a permanent place. An allrounder who can bat in the top six and provide a valuable extra seam option, Christian started at New South Wales, moved to South Australia and then shifted to Victoria ahead of the 2013-14 season. During that summer he was called into Australia's ODI and T20 sides and made the squad for the 2014 World T20 in Bangladesh. He had made his T20 international debut four years earlier and has since become a perennial winner at T20 tournaments. He has played for 16 different franchises in tournaments all over the world, making 11 finals and winning a staggering seven titles. He was Player of the Match in the 2018-19 BBL final for the Melbourne Renegades. ",
            "At his best, Christian offers the complete package of clean-hitting with the bat, a wicket-taking knack with the ball and sharp work in the field. He was called into Australia's Test squad during the home series against India in 2011-12 but was not given a baggy green. The previous summer he had been South Australia's leading run scorer and second top wicket-taker in the Ryobi Cup, and he also filled in as the state's captain. His second move, to Victoria, came after a 2012-13 season in which he was suspended by South Australia after three outbursts in which he damaged change-rooms following his dismissals."

            "Jerome Taylor was just 18 years old, with a handful of matches for Jamaica under his belt, when he was called into the West Indies squad for the final match of their series against Sri Lanka in June 2003. There was never any doubt about the fast bowler's talent. Taylor is a natural in getting the ball to move away and, when at his best, he drew comparisons with West Indies legend Michael Holding. Injuries, however, had a knack of dragging him down.",
            "In a five-year stretch between November 2009 and June 2014, Taylor was able to play only five T20Is and four ODIs, and had his commitment questioned by the WICB. Just before that tough period, he had spearheaded one of West Indies' greatest Test wins, at his home ground in Kingston, by ripping through England with a match haul of 8 for 85. He eventually regained his place in the team for a tour of India in 2014 - which the players abandoned due to a payment dispute with their cricket board - and has been a regular fixture in Tests and ODIs since then.",
            "Taylor's rise to international cricket was rapid. He was named the most promising fast bowler in the 2003 Carib Beer Series, after picking up 21 wickets at 20.14 in six first-class matches. That haul included a second-innings 8 for 59 in Jamaica's five-wicket victory over Trinidad & Tobago, a match in which he took ten wickets for the first time. But a back injury sidelined him from competitive cricket.",
            "He picked up 26 wickets at 16.61 in the Carib Beer Cup in the 2004-05 season, and in the next, he grabbed 12 wickets at 29 to force his way back into the West Indies team. When India toured the West Indies in mid-2006, they ran into an energised Taylor at his best. Quick and accurate, Taylor turned into West Indies' spearhead as the series progressed. His pacy burst on the lifeless surface in St Kitts won many admirers, but it was his lethal performance in Kingston that underlined his worth. Getting the ball to lift off a good length, he thrilled his home crowd with his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests.",
            "He picked up 26 wickets at 27.69 in the 2006-07 season and bagged his then career-best figures in ODIs - 4 for 49, including a hat-trick, when he bowled West Indies to a thrilling win against Australia in the Champions Trophy. He bettered that a year later when he snared 5 for 48 against Zimbabwe, and in 2008 was West Indies' leading bowler in the Test series against Sri Lanka, with 11 wickets in two matches at 24.81. That helped him bag the Jamaica Cricketer-of-the-Year award for 2008. That year he also blitzed a Test century at just under a run a ball, from No. 8, against New Zealand. ",
            "Form on his comeback after back injury in 2014 fuelled his 2015 World Cup dream, where he was West Indies' highest wicket-taker with 17 scalps in seven matches. He was also part of West Indies' World T20 winning squad in 2016. But an unsuccessful run in the longest format in Australia in December 2015-January 2016, when he picked up two wickets in three Tests, resulted in him calling time on his Test career in July 2016."

The change happened five years into his first-class career, when a knee injury forced Ziaur into reshaping his career, though he still bowls decent medium pace from a shortened run-up.",
            "Born in Bedbunia village in Khulna Division, Ziaur's career began in the local leagues in his region. He soon made it to Dhaka where he played for a few years as a pace bowler before breaking into Bangladesh Under-19 team, and then the Khulna divisional team in the National Cricket League.",
            "Even in his early days, batting aggressively came naturally to him. But it was always on the backburner, something of shock value rather than regularly useful in the lower-order. In his debut season, Ziaur picked up 18 wickets before bagging a haul of 30 in the 2005-06. His performance for Khulna and in the Dhaka Premier League over the next two years was noticed, and he was one of those touring in Bangladesh's team for the 2007 World Twenty20. He didn't get a game but continued to do well back home when he took 38 wickets in the 2008-09 season.",
            "At that point, he suffered the injury to his right knee which required surgery as well as a long rest. The changes in his physicality meant that bowling fast was out of the question. His cricket career was on the line, but he got a second chance, as a batsman in the Dhaka league.",
            "Ziaur the batsman took his time, playing out two ordinary seasons before batting well enough for Old DOHS in the Dhaka Premier League and for Chittagong Kings in the Bangladesh Premier League Twenty20s to earn a place in the senior Twenty20 team. ",

In first-class cricket, Ziaur is handy against the old ball and sometimes against the second new ball. His maiden first-class century came against Central Zone in the Bangladesh Cricket League. It was a scintillating innings which contained 15 sixes, as he made 152 off just 143 balls."

He scored 710 runs in ten matches at an average of 59.16, bowled more than he ever had in the past, and took 23 wickets at an average of 17.26 (including twin five-fors in a match against Guyana).",
            "Slotted in at No. 6 for West Indies' home series against India in 2016, Chase did not take long to show he belonged. In his second Test, at Sabina Park, he became only the fourth West Indian, after Denis Atkinson, Collie Smith and Garry Sobers, to take a five-wicket haul and score a hundred in a Test; he bowled more overs than anyone else in India's only innings to finish with 5 for 121, and batted through all of the fifth day to score an unbeaten 137 and lead his side to an improbable draw. He pulled off that feat again in 2017 against Pakistan in Roseau, where he made an unbeaten 101, exactly half of his team's total in the innings, but they failed to chase down a tough 304. The match before, he had made another hundred, this time in a West Indies win.",
            "At the start of 2019, Chase took an eight-for and made 54 in a massive win over England in Barbados. He hit a rough patch batting-wise in Tests in the middle of that year, but nearly made his first ODI hundred in November - he ran out of deliveries and finished on 94 as West Indies chased 195. ",
            "In T20, unlike many of his bigger-hitting West Indies counterparts, Chase has stayed close to home, playing only in the CPL, and mostly for St Lucia Kings there, including in two finals.\n "

Though he began his first-class career batting at Nos. 9 and 10, Devcich eventually worked his way up to the middle order. In his debut match for Northern Districts, against Otago in the 2004-05 State Championship, Devcich batted at No. 9 but made a mark with an unbeaten 94. While he couldn't quite keep up that level of performance in the matches that followed, Devcich built up his credentials as a batsman to become a regular opener in the shorter formats. ",
            "Despite being a consistent performer in the domestic circuit with an ability to strike the ball powerfully, Devcich struggled to seal a permanent spot in the national side.  After a good tour of India and Sri Lanka in 2013 as part of the A team - where he was among the top run-getters against both countries - Devcich earned a place in the senior team's limited-overs of Bangladesh which was held later that year. He scored a half-century on T20I debut, but a poor tour of Sri Lanka followed, where he could manage only six runs in three ODI innings, and he lost his place subsequently. Devcich had to wait another year for an opportunity, which came on the back of a fruitful Champions League T20 in 2014 where he was Northern Districts' second-highest run-getter. He failed, however, to make an impact once again, this time against Pakistan in UAE, scoring 84 runs in three ODI innings at 28.00."

He enjoyed a breakout summer in 2016-17, which culminated in a call-up to Australia's T20I side to play against Sri Lanka in February 2017. Earlier in the season he had scored his maiden first-class century, against Tasmania, and followed that two matches later with another hundred against Queensland.",
            "Turner announced himself on the world stage when he made 84 not out from 43 balls in his second ODI to help Australia chase 359 in Mohali against India in 2019. But despite these heroics, he did not play a single game on the following five-match ODI tour of the UAE and missed selection for the 2019 World Cup squad. Significant right-shoulder issues restricted his throwing ability in the field and he didn't bowl much since 2017, though he initially developed as an offspinning allrounder in first-class cricket. ",
            "Turner made over 350 runs at a strike rate of 154 in the 2021-22 BBL season, including 54 in the final, as Perth Scorchers clinched their fourth title."

            "An express bowler whose career has consisted of Himalayan peaks and oceanic troughs, Mitchell Johnson at his best was as fearsome as fast bowlers come. That summit came during 2013-14, when in successive series he cowed the batsmen of England and South Africa with his speed and aggression. In those eight Tests he collected 59 wickets at 15.23, along with a big bunch of cherries on helmets and gloves. Not surprisingly it led to Johnson winning his first Allan Border Medal, and at the age of 32 he was finally achieving the sorts of feats that Dennis Lillee might have expected when he first spotted Johnson's talent as a 17-year-old. There had been other highlights along the way for Johnson, including brutal spells against South Africa in 2008-09, but the lows of his 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes campaigns left his legacy looking uncertain. Nerves and family problems contributed to those struggles, but a broken toe in 2011 gave him time away from the game and the chance to reflect on where he was going.",
            "It was still far from smooth sailing: he offered little on the 2013 tour of India and was not even picked for the 2013 Ashes in England, but his return for the home Ashes that followed was emphatic. Wearing a moustache reminiscent of Lillee, he delivered a series of fast-bowling spells that would not have been out of place in the Lillee-Thomson era. Johnson intimidated with his bouncer and made England's batsmen seriously uncomfortable; that he was Player of the Series was no surprise. As described by Wisden, the mood changed whenever he tore in: \"This was something visceral: a hush followed by a crescendo\". A 12-wicket Test in Centurion in Australia's next series showed that it was no fluke. After that South African tour Johnson's pace eased off again, but he remained a strike weapon and became the fifth Australian bowler to take 300 wickets in Tests.  "

            "A player of passion with the talent to match, Harbhajan Singh kept the flag flying for  fingerspin in an era of prolific wristspinners, flat pitches and big bats. Bowling with a windmilling, whiplash action, he varied his length and pace, and turned it the other way too. His deadliest ball was the one that climbed wickedly from a length, forcing a hurried jab. In March 2001, it proved too much for the all-conquering Australians, and Harbhajan collected 32 wickets in three Tests - including the first Test hat-trick by an Indian - while none of his team-mates managed more than three.",
            "His personal rivalry with the Australians was responsible for both the highest and the lowest points of his career. Invariably he managed to raise his game against them, and was singularly responsible for Ricky Ponting's low scores on Indian soil - he dismissed him five times for fewer than 12 runs each time in the 2001 series. Some of his punchiest batting performances came against them too. But in 2008 a confrontation with Andrew Symonds created one of the ugliest controversies in cricket, when he was charged with racial abuse, which was reduced to abuse on appeal. But the IPL threw the two of them together, and they forged a relationship as teamm-ates at Mumbai Indians, for whom Harbhajan played ten seasons between 2008 and 2017, even leading them in 20 matches.",
            "Though he was part of India's winning campaign in the inaugural T20 World Cup, in 2007, like many of his contemporaries, he took time to adapt his game to the shortest format from ODIs, in which he was an integral part of the Indian team. However, Harbhajan's legacy will be his contribution to India's dominant home record in Tests and the deadly partnership he forged with Anil Kumble on relatively batting-friendly pitches - they took 366 wickets in 34 matches they played together, in which India was defeated in a series just once. Till R Ashwin surpassed him in 2021, Harbhajan was India's most successful Test offspinner. "

He has gone on to feature in every World Cup game that his country has played, one of only two players to have done so. He signed for Sussex in 1999, spending 5 years there and was part of the squad that lifted the County Championship in 2003.",

But with increasing age he has matured into a very steady middle-order batsman, and his unbeaten 116 against the United Arab Emirates in the 2005 ICC Trophy secured World Cup qualification for Netherlands as they scraped through in 5th place. He was the tournament's leading scorer that year with 474 runs and, in the World Cricket League in Kenya in 2007, he averaged 50.25 as the Netherlands continued their improvement to finish third."

            "Graeme Swann was a wonderfully adaptable spinner, attuned when necessary to a defensive role to allow the quicks time to rest, and also blessed with the ability to dip and turn the ball markedly. He was also one of England's great character cricketers, refreshingly individualistic on and off the field.",
            "In 60 Tests in almost exactly five years, Swann took 255 wickets at a touch under 30 runs apiece, exceeding anyone else in Test cricket in that period, including James  Anderson (232 wickets), Stuart Broad (207) and Dale Steyn (205). He retired as England's sixth-highest wicket-taker, the leading offspinner, and second among all England slow bowlers only to Derek Underwood (297). ",
            "Swann had cunning, flight and turn, which made up for his lack of a doosra. He was also helped by a striking number of left-hand batters in the game during his time, and increased use of technology that made it more likely that umpires would uphold lbw appeals. Of his 255 wickets, 70 were lbw, compared to the other great England offpinner Jim Laker's 32 from 193; 122 of Swann's wickets were of left-handers, whereas Laker only had 29. ",
            "Although he made his international debut as a 20-year-old in an ODI in 2000, Swann only made his mark for England on his Test debut, in Chennai in 2008, taking two wickets in his first over. Within a few months he had usurped Monty Panesar as England's premier spinner, a position he would not relinquish for the rest of his career.",
            "He soon became a match-winner at Test level, and an important part of the ODI and T20I sides. Swann played a key role in the 2009 Ashes wins at Lord's and The Oval, and contributed incisive spells in Durban, Chittagong, Adelaide, Colombo, against Pakistan at Edgbaston and Lord's, against Sri Lanka in Cardiff, and against India at The Oval.",
            "During the 2012 home season, his career hit a blip, but the following winter he helped England to a historic series win in India. Panesar and he claimed 19 of the 20 wickets to fall in the great win in Mumbai, representing one of the greatest spin-bowling double acts in England's Test history. ",
            "Early in 2013, Swann underwent surgery for a long-standing elbow problem, but he was back for that summer's Ashes, taking 26 wickets without ever being at his best. He would not last the return series in Australia, where he managed only seven wickets at 80 in three Tests and then, with the series lost, announced his retirement before the Boxing Day Test.  He admitted later that he felt \"horrendous\" about quitting during the series, but on his career as a whole, he was in no doubt. \"I feel like a lottery winner,\" he said.\n"

            "In a short international limited-overs career Steven Davies felt the benefit and pain the merry-go-round selection policy that England wicketkeepers have been subjected to. He made a surprise international debut in a Twenty20 against West Indies in Trinidad in 2009 but was soon replaced by Craig Kieswetter as England went on to lift the World Twenty20 in 2010.",
            "Davies then replaced Kieswetter in the 50-over side and travelled to Australia in 2010-11 as England's first-choice wicketkeeper in limited-overs cricket and back-up to Matt Prior in the Test squad. Just one game into the seven-match ODI that series that preceded the World Cup, Davies was unexpectedly dumped from the team and replaced by Prior who went on to the World Cup without much success.",
            "Davies had long been earmarked as a player with England potential. It was clear he had talent when he finished above Graeme Hick in the Worcestershire averages in his debut season in 2005, and he was selected for the National Academy and toured the West Indies with England A that winter. At the end of the 2009 season, sensing a need to challenge himself, Davies moved from Worcestershire to Surrey where he was given the responsibility of batting in the top order.",
            "In February 2011 Davies became the first international cricketer to announce that he was gay, revealing the fact in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. He had come out to his family five years earlier and was also already out to his teammates.",
            "The following year, Davies was badly affected by the death of his teammate and friend Tom Maynard, even considering his future in the game. He responded emphatically in 2013, though his stylish runs could not prevent Surrey from being relegated. At the start of 2014, he was regarded by many as a viable candidate for the Test gloves. To the surprise of many, including Surrey, he gave up the gloves early in the season, requesting to be picked as a specialist batter instead. While he was certainly a good enough batsman to justify that - his first-class average hovered around 40 at the time - the decision effectively consigned his England career to the past. The nagging sense was that while Davies was one of the most aesthetically pleasing players on the county circuit, he was yet to fulfil his potential.",
            "Davies' uncertainty over his future role caused him to leave Surrey for Somerset at the end of 2016, the best memory of his farewell season an impeccable century against Yorkshire in the Royal London Cup semi-final at Headingley to take Surrey to their second successive Lord's final. His first season with Somerset began with a loss of form with the bat but 142 against a former county, Surrey, set him on his way and another Taunton hundred, this time against Lancashire, persuaded onlookers that all would be well.",
            "As he reached his mid-30s, Davies' returns dipped somewhat. His first-class average for Somerset hovered around the 30 mark, while he largely gave up white-ball cricket, with Tom Banton ensconsed as the club's wicketkeeper. His contract expires at the end of 2023."

            "Brett Lee excelled as an exponent of extreme speed over a decade without achieving the all-conquering success required to earn the tag of a true Test great. Fast and with a flashy smile that added to his star quality, he finished as Australia's fourth-most successful bowler, with 310 wickets in 76 matches. For most of his career he operated as brutal support for Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie, despite frequent injuries. In his final two years he was a highly dependable attack leader until his body limited his ability in five-day contests.",
            "At his best Lee got outswing with the new ball and reverse with the older one, making him even more difficult for batters trying to steady themselves knowing he could reach 160kph. The charging run-up and leaping celebrations added to the theatre of a bowler who made an instant impact, taking five wickets on debut at the MCG. Forty-two victims came in his opening seven Tests to gain him an A-list reputation, but he was soon in rehab after an elbow operation. His ankles were a popular site for surgery, and there were also side strains and stress fractures in a familiar cycle of breathtaking pace, painful injury and long-term layoff.",
            "Starting by shaking up batters with short balls and yorkers, Lee went on to become a smarter operator under Ricky Ponting's captaincy, not averse to delivering containing spells on occasion. In nine Tests following McGrath's departure, hee stood up with 58 wickets at 21.55 and also won the Allan Border Medal in 2008. During that period he helped keep the rebuilding side on top of the world. ",
            "Life soon became harder again and after returning from more ankle surgery - his last act in a Test was limping off the MCG with a broken foot - he missed the 2009 Ashes with a side strain. England wasn't a kind host for Lee, who was consoled by Andrew Flintoff during his absorbing yet heartbreaking batting near-miss at Edgbaston in 2005. He was a courageous run-maker who would deflect or absorb the efforts of opposing fast bowlers as they searched for payback.",
            "A gentleman off the field, he was aggressive on it but rarely went over the top in comparison to some of his team-mates, although his bouncers at tailenders could make for uncomfortable viewing. Lee retired from Tests at the beginning of 2010 to prolong his career in the shorter forms: in those affairs he could stay true to himself by attempting to operate at optimum speed while reducing the load on his aching body. He finally retired from all international cricket in July 2012."

At the time of Rashid's recall to the limited-overs set-up in 2015, no legspinner had taken more than five white-ball wickets for England; over the next six years, Rashid took more than 200.",
            "His success in the limited-overs game owed much to his variation - and his wicked googly in particular - and it was no great surprise when he got his Test debut in 2015 against Pakistan. Rashid took 60 wickets in 19 Tests, but often struggled for control and a long-standing shoulder complaint meant his focus returned to the shorter formats after the 2019 tour of the Caribbean.",
            "Born in Bradford, he became the third Yorkshire-born player of Asian extraction to represent the county in 2006, and his 6 for 67  on debut against Warwickshire at Scarborough felt like a breakthrough moment. In 2008, he earned call-ups as a back-up player on Test tours to India and the Caribbean after taking 62 Championship wickets.",
            "He made his England debut in 2009 during the World T20, playing in all four of England's games, but had a chastening time on the tour to South Africa the following winter: his only over in the T20I series cost 25 runs and his three overs in an ODI in Centurion were taken for 27. ",
            "Rashid's county progress was mixed over the next few years but as he reached his mid-20s, he became a more prolific run-scorer, and he thrived with Jason Gillespie as his head coach at Yorkshire, who later took him to the Big Bash with Adelaide Strikers, with whom he won titles in 2014 and 2015. For England, he was part of the side that reached the final of the 2016 World T20 and the semi-final of the 2017 Champions Trophy, and took 11 wickets in the 2019 World Cup. ",
            "His introduction to Test cricket was brutal as he returned 0 for 163 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2015, but his 5 for 64 in the second innings demonstrated why England had been so keen to turn him into a red-ball bowler. He was their leading wicket-taker in India in 2016-17 with 23 - 13 more than anyone else - but averaged the wrong side of 35 and leaked 3.70 runs an over.",
            "Controversy reared its head in 2018, when, months after signing a white-ball-only contract with Yorkshire, Rashid was handed a Test recall for the home series against India by Ed Smith, a selector keen to think outside the box. He took ten wickets in the series before forming part of a spin trio with Moeen Ali and Jack Leach during England's 3-0 win in Sri Lanka, but after an expensive Test in the Caribbean in early 2019, he was left out once more.",
            "However, he remained arguably the pre-eminent asset in England's rebooted white-ball team, and despite despite a long-standing shoulder issue that has required constant monitoring, in 2022 he added the T20 World Cup crown to the 50-over title from 2019. His displays at the sharp end of that competition in Australia epitomised his value - a combined return of 4 for 58 in his final 12 overs of the tournament, including 2 for 22 in the final against Pakistan."

            "Another product of Harare's Churchill High School and Takashinga Club, the lanky Maruma started off as a legspinner, before shifting his focus to batting. He became so good at it that he made his Test debut, against Bangladesh in 2013, he opened the batting. ",
            "The move up the batting ranks came after a highly successful domestic season in 2012-13, when he averaged 51.80 in 12 innings for Mountaineers, scoring one century and four fifties. That came on the back of two consistent seasons with the bat, in 2011-12 and 2010-11. Most of those runs were scored from No.5 or 6, yet his organised technique and temperament won him a promotion to the top of the order for his Test debut. ",
            "Even as his batting improved, Maruma's legspin took a back seat. In 2009-10, he was the leading wicket-taker by some distance in the Logan Cup, the domestic first-class tournament, taking 58 wickets at 18.94. During that period, he was clearly one of the better slow bowlers in Zimbabwe. In the last two seasons before his Test debut (2012-13 and 2011-12), though, he only took 16 wickets from as many matches, as he lost his stock delivery, the legbreak, and started bowling a mixture of googlies and seam-up quicker deliveries."

            "An aggressive, but organised left-hander from Canterbury, Henry Nicholls' burgeoning domestic form brought him to the notice of the New Zealand selectors, who called him up to the national team in the 2015-16 home season. Though he would earn a Test cap in February 2016, it was in one-day domestic cricket that Nicholls had largely made his mark, hitting 454 runs in the 2014-15 Ford Trophy at an average of 75.66, with strike-rate of 105.82. Consequently promoted to the New Zealand A team, he further outlined his value in a home series against Sri Lanka A, hitting two hundreds and a fifty in his three innings in the unofficial Tests, before averaging 84.50 in the one-dayers. ",
            "His impact at the top level wasn't quite immediate - it wasn't until his fifth ODI innings that Nicholls crossed fifty, and though he scored a half-century on Test debut against Australia, didn't quite do enough to secure his place in the XI. However, coach Mike Hesson spoke of Nicholls as a player worth investing in, and the returns did eventually begin to come. He hit a maiden Test hundred against South Africa at the Basin Reserve, in March 2017.",
            "Over the next two years he made himself the bedrock of New Zealand's Test middle order and played some pivotal innings. He made an unbeaten 145 against England in Auckland that helped set up a famous series win. His next Test century was part of a 212-run stand with skipper Kane Williamson in Abu Dhabi to help New Zealand to a drought-breaking away series win over Pakistan."

            "Originally from Gujranwala, Pakistan, where he came up through the U-19 pathway, Kaleemullah migrated to Oman in his early twenties and made his debut for that side in January 2017 in the Desert T20 tournament in the UAE. However, he had to bide his time on the bench for nearly a year afterwards, until the ICC revised its eligibility guidelines for non-citizen residents in October 2017. That opened the door for him to seize the next available opportunity, starting with 2018 World Cricket League Division Two in Namibia. ",
            "Since then, he has become an effective and sometimes devastating presence in the Oman bowling attack. Kaleemullah has a reputation as a rhythm bowler who uses his height and bounce to unsettle opposing batters. His best success has come in lengthy new-ball spells probing away with line and length, whether it is bowling four straight overs in T20 cricket or seven to eight overs in ODIs. He was a key member of the bowling unit that helped take Oman to ODI status in 2019 and has remained a steady wicket-taker in the years since.\n"

            "A batsman who played 15 Tests and 56 ODIs for West Indies, Runako Morton died in a car crash when just 33. His international career with West Indies spanned eight years, but he unable to win a regular place in the side, largely because of the controversies he was embroiled in.",
            "His run-ins with authority started early, when he was expelled from the West Indian Academy in July 2001, for a series of regulation breaches. He refused to be bowed, however, and continued to accumulate runs for Leeward Islands in the Busta Cup. In February 2002, he was called into an injury-plagued West Indian squad as a replacement for Marlon Samuels, and was tipped to become one of the few Test cricketers from tiny island of Nevis.",
            "But he threw away his opportunity when he pulled out of the ICC Champions Trophy in September 2002, after lying about the death of his grandmother. His career slipped further down the pan when he was arrested (though released without charge) in January 2004, following a stabbing incident, but in May 2005, he was given a third chance at redemption when he was recalled to the one-day squad to face South Africa although he didn't get a game.",
            "He got his chance later that month against Pakistan at home, and was then picked for the 2005-06 tour to New Zealand, where he proved his worth with a fighting century - his maiden one-day hundred - in a losing cause. He followed it up with another ton, in the away series against Zimbabwe, but soon made it into the record books for his painstaking 31-ball duck in the final of the DLF Cup against Australia in Malaysia. It was the slowest ODI duck, beating Phil Simmons's earlier record that had consumed 23 balls.",
            "It certainly got his eye in, however, as Morton made an unbeaten 90 in his next meeting with the Australians, in the Champions Trophy. From that moment on, however, his form fell away, and he was omitted from the West Indian squad for the subsequent World Cup. His in-and-out career continued with a recall for the 2007 England trip and he made runs against Zimbabwe later that year but his form never remained consistent."

            "Michael Yardy's England career effectively ended when he flew home from Colombo with clinical depression three days before the quarterfinal of the 2011 World Cup. Yardy, whose worth in the side had been under scrutiny, had combated the illness for much of his career and as the cricket community rallied around him there was general pleasure when he returned to county cricket with Sussex in the early part of the 2011 summer. By the time he was awarded a benefit in 2014, he had spent 15 years at the county, winning seven trophies, including three Championships, and had turned himself in that time from a humdrum county professional by no means certain to make the grade to a highly-respected figure.",
            "His farewell season in 2015 coincided with a shock Sussex relegation from Division One of the Champion ship, but as he battled gamely - and ultimately in vain - to keep his side up, the admiration of supporters and opposition was apparent. There was a standing ovation at Hove for a century against the chamnpions Yorkshire, a farewell hundred at Hove against Somerset, and handshakes all round when he resisted again against Yorkshire at Headingley in the final match of the season. His last over in white-ball cricket - in the NatWest Blast quarter-final against Northants at Hove - went less well as David Willey struck 34 off one over and only the fact that one ball fell a yard short at midwicket stopped Yardy conceding six sixes in an over.",
            "Yardy first suffered from depression when his professional satisfaction was at its peak, He had been part of the England squad that won the Twenty20 World Cup in the Caribbean in 2010 but later said: \"'I wasn't enjoying life. Everything was a real struggle. I couldn't understand why I was in such a bad place because everything seemed to be going quite merrily from the outside. I was a World Cup winner, I was playing for a very successful England team and Sussex were playing really good Twenty20 cricket. Everything I had worked for in my professional life was going well and my family life was great and you are thinking, 'What are you doing? Snap out of it, this is ridiculous.'\"",
            "Yardy's illness first had a direct impact upon his career when he pulled out of England's last one-day international against Pakistan at the Rose Bowl in September 2010. At the end of a fractious series, with revelations about Pakistani spot-fixing in full swing, nobody outside the England set-up bothered to consider why Yardy's Sussex team-mate Luke Wright had been preferred. He confided in England's coach Andy Flower and sought professional help to alleviate the illness but, like Marcus Trescothick before him, found touring with England exacerbated the problem. He would lie awake until the early hours. In Colombo, his international career - 28 ODIs and 14 T20s - came to an abrupt halt. \"I was out of my comfort zone,\" he said. \"By the last training session I was literally like a zombie.'",
            "He came back too soon and had to leave the pitch midway through a game against Middlesex at Hove, struck by a sense that he was in 'danger' on the field. But he rallied again, proving himself once more to be a dedicated and selfless captain. He relinquished the Sussex captaincy in two formats of the game in July 2013 but he continued to skipper the side in Friends Life t20, leading Sussex to their second finals day in four seasons and was also named the 1st XI Fielder of the Year, with his 34 catches across all formats rivalling numbers taken by wicketkeepers around the county circuit. He could anticipate an enthusiastically-supported benefit in 2014 after 15 years with the county.  In that time he has been the bedrock of the county during the most successful period in their history during which they have won seven trophies including three County Championships.",
            "Yardy was never the most elegant player, with bat or ball, but he could be mightily effective.  A compact (stodgy in his early days) left-hander, he cemented his place by recording his maiden first-class century in defeat against Surrey, in the final match of the 2004 season. He began 2005 in identical fashion, with another hundred against Surrey, to trigger a run of form that carried him to the top of the domestic batting charts.",
            "His zenith arrived against the Bangladeshis at Hove, where he scored 257 - the highest score by a Sussex batsman against a touring team, beating George Cox jr's 234 against the 1946 Indians - and followed up with a career-best 5 for 83 with his flat, left-arm spin, having started life as a medium-pacer. That was exactly double his previous tally of first-class wickets. It proved to be an effective career move.",
            "His good form continued throughout the 2005 season leading to selection for the England A tour of West Indies, and ultimately a chance to push for a World Cup place when he was picked for the Champions Trophy. Though his bowling impressed, England's strange insistence that he bat at No. 4 meant that the overall image suffered, and he was quietly jettisoned. He was groomed as Chris Adams' success at Hove and took the reins in 2009, leading the county to two one-day trophies - the Twenty20 Cup and Pro40 - but also presided over Championship relegation.",
            "His steely approach in one-day cricket, however, kept the England selectors interested and when Flower recognised the need for the limited-overs side to find a left-arm spinning allrounder Yardy was recalled for the 2010 World Twenty20. Darting the ball in, he formed a potent spin partnership with Graeme Swann that helped England achieve their first ever success in a global ICC event. That secured him a regular place during the 2010 season and then a berth at the World Cup where his problems were to mount once more."

            "- One of the most sought-after players in T20 cricket, Starc had played only 27 matches across the first 15 editions of the IPL, with injuries, international commitments, and personal reasons kept keeping him away at various points.",
            "- In the two IPLs that Starc played before KKR got him for 2024, he took 14 and 20 wickets for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), in 2014 and 2015.",
            "First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals.",
            "His challenge has been to take that white-ball form and perform just as consistently with the red ball, although overall his Test career numbers are also outstanding. He struggled to gain the consistent backing of the selectors early in his Test career and was often in one Test and out the next, but in 2015 he finally enjoyed a solid run of Test cricket until an ankle injury stopped him during the home summer. His career-best match haul of 11 for 94 came in the notable surroundings of Galle - albeit in an Australia defeat - and he claimed 22 wickets in four Tests during the 2017-18 Ashes. He took his 200th Test wicket in his 50th Test in February of 2019 joining an elite group of Australian bowlers although play only one of the five Ashes Tests in the 2019 series. When England toured down under in 2021-22, Starc produced some of his best form in the three matches where the series was decided and went on to claim the Allan Border Medal as Australia's male player of the year."

            "An offspinner who has always been economical without being incisive, Prosper Utseya was first introduced to the game at Chipembere Primary School in the Harare township of Highfield, and won a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School. A promising talent at school level, he made his first-class debut - opening the batting in the first innings - for Mashonaland A at the age of 15. In 2004, Utseya was unexpectedly thrust into the Zimbabwe national team against Sri Lanka at the age of 19 when the rebel players withdrew. He held onto a place in a weakened national side and, somewhat surprisingly, took up the captaincy from Terry Duffin in 2006.",
            "Utseya came of age with the ball during the tour to West Indies in May 2006, where his flight and spin belied his lack of experience and years. But there weren't a great deal of happy memories for Zimbabwe in the years that followed and Utseya tendered his resignation as national captain after the side's disappointing performance at the World Twenty20 in May 2010, saying that he was stepping down in the interest of the team's future development.",
            "As it turned out, the move also allowed Utseya to focus on his own development. He formed a useful spin-bowling partnership with Ray Price, the pair making an odd, yet effective, couple and even opening the bowling together when conditions warranted it. Utseya honed his game as a limited-overs cricketer, his parsimonious bowling combining with surprisingly agile fielding and a can-do batting attitude to make him an automatic pick for Zimbabwe in ODIs and a senior member of the squad. He became the second Zimbabwean to take an ODI hat-trick in the course of his 5 for 36 against South Africa in August 2014, and later in the same series sealed his place in Zimbabwean cricketing folklore when he hit Mitchell Starc for a towering six to take Zimbabwe to their first ODI victory over Australia in 31 years."

            "Yasir Arafat is an all-rounder of typically Pakistani ethos: ideal for the attacking mood of the limited-overs formats and was also capable enough to win three Test caps. When his international career came to an end in 2009, somewhat prematurely with his 30th birthday still distant, he proved himself a staple of the English county circuit, sharing his talent around six counties by the time Hampshire signed him for their T20 campaign in 2015. ",
            "He was on the fringes of the Pakistan squad for a number of years though given the allrounders ahead of him - Abdul Razzaq, Shahid Afridi and even Shoaib Malik - limited his chances.  He could generate pace and swing and was always liable to turn a game even as his career entered the veteran stage. He was also a dangerous lower-order plunderer, good enough to strike five first-class hundreds as well as one in List A cricket.",
            "His type of straight, full, skiddy bowling courtesy a slingy action accounted for Andrew Flintoff's wicket at an ODI in Karachi in December 2005. It has also helped him to nine wickets against England in a warm-up game earlier during the same series .  In that year he also took five wickets in six balls for Rawalpindi against the national champions Faisalabad in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. This had only been achieved three times previously in first-class cricket, by Bill Copson in 1937, William Henderson in 1938, and Pat Pocock in 1972. Arafat was the only bowler to take the wickets spread over two innings.",
            "Yasir's first experience of cricket in the UK was for Scotland before he was recruited by Sussex in the 2006 Championship season. In his first three games, he took 17 wickets with two five-wicket hauls as well as scoring a couple of fifties. An impressive start to the 2007 county season with Kent, where he starred with ball as well the bat, saw Arafat being awarded a central contract for the first time. With injuries to Mohammad Asif and Umar Gul, Arafat was called up as replacement and made his Test debut against India at Bangalore in December 2007. ",
            "But it was county cricket where he was in most demand. Sussex, Surrey, Lancashire, Somerset and Hampshire also came calling when they needed some bowling enterprise in one-day cricket. Perth Scorchers also came calling in 2013."

            "A modern-day offspinner who relies on the doosra as much as on other variations of flight and speed, Saeed Ajmal made a relatively late entry into international cricket, at the age of 30, but is doing his best to make up for lost time, quickly moving up to be regarded among the best spinners in the game today. Ajmal didn't play his first Test till almost 32, but showed immediately that he belonged, taking five wickets in his debut Test against Sri Lanka in Galle in 2009. ",
            "His golden run, though, started in 2011, when he showed superb control over all his variations - the offspinner, the doosra and the subtle changes in speed and flight. Unlike many offspinners who change their line when bowling the doosra, Ajmal tends to bowl the offspinner and the doosra from around the same line - on or just outside off - which makes it much tougher for batsmen to pick his variations. In 2011 he was the leading wicket-taker in Tests, with 50 in eight matches. But the best series of his young career came early in 2012, when he destroyed the batting line-up of the best team in the world, England, taking 24 wickets in just three games at 14.70. In the process, he clearly won the battle of offspinners against the highly rated Graeme Swann. "

            "A baby face perched on a two-metre body, Shaheen Afridi's story is trademark Pakistani. An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, he's been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years. In a more intimate circle, he was destined for great achievements well before his teenage years, with an international cricketer for an elder brother.",
            "Riaz Afridi made his solitary Test performance for Pakistan in 2004, when Shaheen was just four years old. He pushed Shaheen to hard-ball cricket following years of the younger brother enjoying success in Pakistan's informal tape-ball circuit. In 2015, FATA selected him after an U-16 talent hunt programme. His pace, physique and fitness won him an U-16 tour of Australia, and since then, he's been progressing through the youth squads. ",
            "He burst into the nation's consciousness with 8 for 39 on Quaid-e-Azam Trophy debut, the best-ever figures by a debutant in the competition. Later, he was picked for the PSL, where figures of five wickets for four runs in a group game for Lahore Qalandars won him a place in the T20I squad against the West Indies. ",
            "He became the first cricketer born after the turn of the millennium to represent Pakistan when he played the third T20I against the West Indies. He was later handed an ODI debut in the Asia Cup, where he replaced Mohammad Amir in the side. In December, he became the 35th player to make his Test debut for Pakistan under the age of 19.",
            "There is more to him than just his story, however compelling that may be in its own right. He stands at an imposing 6ft 6in, though a sweet, child-like smile and a harmless demeanour perhaps takes some of the aura away. He has the intelligence to take advantage of his height to extract bounce on the docile pitches of the UAE, while a mean yorker has proved especially difficult for batsmen to deal with. Most impressively, he can hit a good length time and again, and appears to have the temperament for a long career at this level. "

            "Considering the type of stuff floating around in his gene pool, it would have been surprising if Shaun Pollock had not been an international cricketer - and a very good one at that. Dad Peter led the South African attack through the 1960s; uncle Graeme was one of the finest, if not the finest, left-hander to play the game. Shaun has bits of both in his makeup, but it is as an immaculate, Hadlee-esque, line and length seamer that he has established himself. At the start of his first-class career, though, he was both slippery and aggressive and his Natal team-mates delighted in totting up the number of batsmen he pinned match after match. He was brought into the South African Test side against Michael Atherton's England tourists in 1995/96 and although his father was the convener of selectors, there was never a hint of nepotism and the younger Pollock took quickly to the higher level. ",
            "In 1996 he had a spell with Warwickshire cut short because of an ankle injury and missed the tour to India at the end of that year. But he soon returned to resume his new-ball partnership with Allan Donald and this pairing was the springboard of much of South Africa's success during the latter half of the 1990s. Indeed, it is possible to argue that the emergence of Pollock inspired Donald to greater heights as the latter found himself with a partner who both complemented and challenged him. Perhaps the straightest bowler in world cricket, Pollock is able to move the ball both ways at a lively pace. He also possesses stamina and courage in abundance as in proved in Adelaide in 1998 when he toiled on hour after hour in blazing heat to take 7 for 87 in 41 overs on a perfect batting pitch. ",
            "If there is a criticism of Pollock, it is that he has underperformed with the bat, but most Test teams would be perfectly happy to have him in their side if he never scored a run. Pollock was thrust into the captaincy in April 2000 when Hansie Cronje was drummed out of the game, and he faced the biggest challenge of his career - to lift a shocked and demoralised South African side. However, after a solid start to his captaincy, he lost some credibility after a 3-0 drubbing in Australia in 2001-02, and was later blamed for South Africa's disastrous World Cup in which they failed to qualify for the Super Sixes. As a result, Pollock immediately lost the captaincy and was replaced by Graeme Smith. \nThough his nagging brilliance around offstump remains, his pace and ability to take wickets at the top of the order has dipped.

            "A left-arm spinner from Northwood Boys High, the alma mater of Shaun Pollock, Keshav Maharaj emerged at a time when South Africa began to take spin seriously. For several seasons in the mid 2010s, spinners were among the leading wicket-takers in South Africa's first-class competition. Maharaj was among them in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and was rewarded with an international call-up the following summer.",
            "In his youth, Maharaj was a pace bowler, whose father played for Natal B during segregation years. He turned to spin on a whim in the nets one afternoon at school. He found that it worked and stuck to it. Maharaj's secret was his accuracy. At the Dolphins, he was able to combine that with an ability to take wickets at key moments.",
            "During the opening first-class match of the 2016-17 season, Maharaj picked up 13 for 157, and was then told he would be on South Africa's Test tour to Australia. Maharaj debuted at the WACA, an unusual place for a spinner, given the conditions, but did a remarkable job. In an innings in which he had to hold one end when Dale Steyn was injured, Maharaj bowled well enough to allow the other two seamers to be rotated at the other side. He took 3 for 56 in the first innings, four in the match, and scored an unbeaten 41 to show great promise for the future."

He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. ",
            "He made his first-class debut for Khulna in the 2013-14 season and, after taking eight wickets in the U-19 World Cup in the UAE, he was surprisingly picked for Bangladesh A's tour of West Indies. Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08. ",
            "This was when Mustafizur started to develop the left-armer's offcutter, which was delivered as a spinner does but with the added ability of making it carry to the wicketkeeper standing back. The story of Anamul Haque's dare that got him to bowl the delivery will go into Bangladeshi cricket folklore, as will the early support he received from Mashrafe Mortaza, who spotted him randomly in the Mirpur nets.",
            "Soon enough, the Bangladesh selectors picked Mustafizur for the one-off T20I against Pakistan and then, midway through 2015, for the ODI series against India when he became only the second bowler after Brian Vitori to take five-wicket hauls in his first two ODIs, paving the way for Bangladesh's first-ever ODI series win over India."

            "- He has played for Royal Challengers Bengaluru with great success but now plays for Punjab Kings, who bought him for INR 11.75 crore in the December 2023 auction.",
            "A right-arm seamer with a big outswinger, Harshal Patel could have moved to the USA with his family, but he stayed on in India to pursue cricket. After taking 23 wickets at an impressive average of 11 in the 2008-09 Under-19 Vinoo Mankad Trophy, Harshal made his List-A debut for Gujarat in 2008-09. Harshal also played for India in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand and soon bagged an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians.",
            "Unable to find a place in the Gujarat side, Harshal moved to Haryana and made an immediate impact in his debut Ranji Trophy season in 2011-12, running through Karnataka and Rajasthan with eight-fors in the quarter-final and semi-final. He finished that Ranji season with 28 wickets and made his IPL debut for Royal Challengers Bangalore against Delhi Daredevils in the 2012 edition. ",
            "Harshal, however, was largely seen as a back-up seamer in the franchise set-up, instead of a first-choice option. He did not get a game in IPL 2013, but was bought back by the franchise in the 2014 player auction. While his first-class form dipped in between, he made a strong comeback in the 2015-16 season. His tally of 22 wickets in Ranji Trophy 2015-16 added to a haul of 13 wickets in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, in which he also picked up his maiden List A five-for. He was retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the IPL 2016 player auction.",
            "After fighting through a period of self-doubts, Harshal roared back by picking up 52 wickets in nine matches at the 2019-20 Ranji Trophy, breaking left-arm spinner Rajinder Goel's 36-year-old record for the most wickets in a season for Haryana.",
            "But it was in the the 50-over Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy that season where his all-round prowess came to the fore. He picked up 19 wickets at an economy of 7.04, the joint second-most that season, just one behind stopper R Sai Kishore. He also contributed massively with the bat, making 374 runs at an average of 31.16 and a strike rate of 165.48.",
            "Ahead of IPL 2021, he was traded to Royal Challengers Bangalore after a brief stint with Delhi Capitals. It turned out to be a breakthrough year, where he finished with 32 wickets, the joint-most in an IPL season with Dwayne Bravo. His mastery over the dipping yorker and several slower variations earned him plaudits. ",
            "The performances were enough to impress the national selectors, and a T20I debut followed against the touring New Zealand side in November 2020. In February 2021, Harshal was bought for a mind-boggling INR 10.75 crore (USD 1.4 million) by Royal Challengers. It was 53.75 times his previous IPL salary."

            "Future generations might look at Andrew Flintoff's career figures and wonder what all the fuss was about. In Tests he averaged 31 with bat and 32 with ball. For all the talk of his fearsome fast bowling, there were only three five-fors among his 226 wickets. His one-day figures were good without being outstanding, and his Lancashire ones nothing special. But what the stats don't show is his presence, and the uplifting effect Flintoff at his finest had on his team-mates and crowds. The game treasures few things more than an all-action allrounder: Flintoff became one of English cricket's iconic figures and his presence helped to gain the game popularity in the country at the start of the 21st century.",
            "\"Freddie\" was selected for England in 1998 as much on promise as performance, and underperformed at first, not helped by problems with weight and attitude. Juggernauting in and bowling at 90mph was inevitably a strain: his knees and ankles took multiple poundings from pitches and surgeons' scalpels.",
            "His bowling was always wholehearted and occasionally magnificent, when he probed away outside off with a hint of reverse swing at high pace. As a batter, he was always correct and powerful, if sometimes hesitant against quality spin. ",
            "It wasn't until the New Zealand tour early in 2002 that he finally scored a Test century or took more than four wickets in a match. He looked established at last - but then another injury kept him out of the 2002-03 Ashes, although he was fit enough for the World Cup that followed in South Africa, where he was the most economical bowler on view.",
            "That kicked off Flintoff's golden period - three home seasons when he was at his princely peak. In 2004 he bowled at his fastest - and also smacked a rollicking Test-best 167 against West Indies at Edgbaston, when one of his seven sixes was memorably dropped by his father in the stands. And then there was the crowning glory of 2005, when he bestrode the Ashes series and was undoubtedly the leading cricketer in the world. The photograph of him consoling Brett Lee after England narrowly beat Australia at Edgbaston became the image that captured one of the great Test series.",
            "After that, Flintoff's body started rebelling. To make matters worse he was horribly miscast as captain in Australia in 2006-07, sometimes looking forlorn as his team sank to a 5-0 whitewash. And England's 2007 World Cup campaign will be best remembered for Flintoff's embarrassing tumble from a pedalo after a late-night drinking session.",
            "He coaxed one last big effort out of his creaking joints in 2009, demolishing the Aussies at Lord's before virtually ensuring the return of the urn with the pinpoint run out of Ricky Ponting at The Oval. In September 2010 came the increasingly inevitable announcement that the body couldn't take it. One of cricket's nearly-greats had gone.\n"

But he has failed to really push on after the early promise and has struggled against high quality pace bowling, despite being strong on the cut and pull. He is an impressive fielder in a variety of positions but is generally used in the gully area."

He flirted with the England one-day side in South Africa in 1999-2000, before slipping out of the picture until after the 2003 World Cup. Born in Udaipur, India, but raised in Wolverhampton, Solanki made his debut for Worcestershire as a 16-year-old and instantly caught the eye with his wristy driving and effortless flicks. ",
            "Test recognition seemed only a matter of time as he worked his way through the various representative levels and onto two England A tours, but he was a disappointment in his first eight ODIs, with a top score of 24 and a rash of lapses in his usually silken fielding. But he continued to score heavily for Worcestershire, and after the retirement of several senior players in 2003 he was recalled by England at the age of 26. He started gloriously with a sparkling century against South Africa at The Oval, flirted with oblivion while mustering 11 runs in three outings against Bangladesh, but was recalled to the squad for England's Champions Trophy campaign at the end of the 2004 season. He was in and out the side before the selectors finally lost patience in 2007. He also wrote his name in history by being cricket's first super substitute during a one-day international against Australia in 2005.",
            "After a decade at New Road, he was appointed Worcestershire's captain in 2005, remaining at the helm until resigning near the end of the 2010 season. His acumen also led him to be elected as chairman of the Professional Cricketers Association in 2009. ",
            "Just as it seemed that he was certain to end his career at New Road, he signed a two-year contract with Surrey in July 2012 at the age of 36. He had scored more than 16,000 first-class runs for Worcestershire and served his county well, but financial pressures contributed to his release. Solanki's attraction to Surrey was obvious. The club had recently lost three of their first-choice batsmen: Tom Maynard, to a tragic accident; the club captain and Maynard's flatmate, Rory Hamilton-Brown, to long-term compassionate leave; and Mark Ramprakash to retirement.",
            "Solanki did not disappoint, batting with class and reliability in Championship cricket, providing experience in a youthful top order. Even at 38, he had lost none of his innate style, and Surrey extended his involvement at the club until the end of 2015. By the time he called it a day, he had more than 18,000 first-class runs to his credit and a whole lot of respect. "

            "Upstanding, self-effacing and privately educated, Andrew Strauss was the archetypical England captain, and one of their most successful ones. His understated authority underpinned England's rise to the top of the world rankings - for the first time in 31 years - in a journey that included a home Ashes win in 2009, an even sweeter victory in Australia for the first time since 1986-87, and a 4-0 whitewash to usurp No. 1-ranked India in 2011.",
            "A compact left-hand opener, Strauss was severe on the cut shot, efficient off his pads and workmanlike everywhere else. Though most comfortable with pace on the ball, Strauss made two centuries against an Australia attack that included Shane Warne in 2005, and tenacious back-to-back hundreds against India in Chennai in 2008. ",
            "His early county cricket with Middlesex did not exactly suggest a star in the making, but following a few one-day caps in 2003-04, Strauss was called up for the first Test against New Zealand after Michael Vaughan twisted his knee in the Lord's nets. He responded with a confident century, and was on his way to another in the second innings when Nasser Hussain ran him out 17 short. But Hussain had seen enough: with Vaughan set to return, he announced his immediate retirement and Strauss' England career was set.       ",
            "Strauss led England to victory at home against Pakistan in 2006 in the absence of the injured Vaughan and Andrew Flintoff, but despite his success, Flintoff was chosen to lead the side in the Ashes that winter. The series whitewash instigated a slump in form that saw Strauss go 15 matches without a Test hundred. Then, with his England spot looking desperately insecure, he produced an eight-hour 177, his highest Test score, to seal a series win in Napier and salvage his career. ",
            "When Kevin Pietersen - Vaughan's successor as captain - and coach Peter Moores fell out spectacularly in 2009, England turned to Strauss, who forged a successful partnership with new team director Andy Flower. ",
            "Despite centuries in the 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes, Strauss struggled elsewhere and when England lost four consecutive Tests in the 2011-12 winter, murmurings began about his future. He began the 2012 season with two hundreds against West Indies, but then had a terrible time both on and off the field against South Africa - England lost the series and with it the No. 1 ranking, Strauss scored 107 runs in six innings, and the Pietersen controversy went from bad to worse. A week after the end of that Test series, Strauss announced his retirement from all international cricket, having played 100 Tests, and having led England to victory in 24 out of 50 Tests in charge.",
            "He was appointed as the ECB's director of cricket in early 2015 and was a key figure in England's transformation into a world-beating one-day side.\n"

His walk-across-the-stumps technique isn't as crabby as Shivnarine Chanderpaul's, and he is scrawny next to Matthew Hayden and Shane Watson, but Katich has been a must-have man at the top of Australia's order in the second stage of his career. ",
            "In phase one, which began with a Test debut in 2001 and included a spot in the 2005 Ashes loss, Katich was overly intense. Learning to enjoy his job was central to the stunning revival from seemingly washed up domestic batsman to respected Test player. Rather than trying to prove anything to the Australia selectors who cut his national contract in 2007, he conceded he was struggling and deserved to be dropped. The 2007-08 season was the turning point, with his 1506 Pura Cup runs for New South Wales earning him another chance in a baggy green. The fun continued when he quickly became a national fixture with six hundreds in 16 matches, even though he was playing out of position."

With the new ball, Thakur's at-the-batsman method forms a neat counterpoint to Dhawal Kulkarni's more metronomic style, and the two combined brilliantly to win Mumbai their 41st Ranji Trophy title in February 2016. Thakur picked up eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match.",

Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy in his debut season of 2012-13, but he did not play a major role in the triumph, picking up only four wickets in four matches at an average of 82.",

The 2014-15 season was even better, Thakur finishing joint-top of the Ranji Trophy bowling charts with 48 wickets at 20.81. That earned him a call-up to the India A squad for four-day games against Australia A and South Africa A. Later that year, playing for the Board President's XI, he bagged a four-wicket haul against the touring South Africans, his wickets including those of Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla."

            "At the time of his India debut in 2012, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seemed the answer to the side's fast-bowling scarcity; though middling in pace, he produced swing both ways and had a devastating inswinger. In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013. ",
            "Bhuvneshwar demonstrated his mastery of line and length early, when at 19 he worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first duck in domestic first-class cricket, in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy final. He was handy with the bat too - in the 2012-13 Duleep Trophy semi-final he scored 128 batting at No. 8. ",
            "He was one of the lone bright spots on India's otherwise wretched tour of England in 2014, taking 19 wickets - including 6 for 82 in the win at Lord's - at 26.63. However, an ankle injury in Australia put him out of commission for most of the next year, and he played just one game in the 2015 ODI World Cup. When he returned he wasn't quite the same bowler - he had traded swing for increased pace, but not always effectively. Despite two more five-fors in 2016, against West Indies away and New Zealand at home, his appearances in Tests became more sporadic as injuries dogged him, and he played his last series against South Africa in 2018. ",
            "It was in white-ball cricket that Bhuvneshwar found his niche. In 2013, six months into his ODI career, he picked up 4 for 8 against Sri Lanka in a tri-series game in the Caribbean, and finished as the leading wicket-taker with ten wickets in four games. By 2017 he had formed a devastating partnership with Jasprit Bumrah, and developed slower balls and yorkers that made him India's go-to bowler at the death. In February 2018, he became the second Indian bowler after Yuzvendra Chahal to take five wickets in a T20I, against South Africa in Johannesburg. In 2022, he went one better, picking up 5 for 4 against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup. ",
            "Bhuvneshwar's rise in white-ball cricket mirrored his success in the IPL. He was handed a contract by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2009 but went two seasons without playing a game in the tournament. After another three unremarkable seasons with Pune Warriors, he was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2014, and quickly rose through the ranks to become the lynchpin of their powerplay and death bowling. He took upwards of 18 wickets in each of his first four seasons, won the purple cap two years in a row, in 2016 and 2017, and was instrumental in Sunrisers' only title win, in 2016. Though his performances tapered off in later seasons, he remains the franchise's all-time leading wicket-taker.\n"

Able to deliver a legbreak, googly, carrom ball, doosra and a stock offspinner with astounding control, he had impressed Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene so much as a net bowler at a practice session that Jayawardene requested he be fast-tracked to the national squad.",
            "Dananjaya played three matches of the World Cup, including the final, but went out of favour with the selectors once Jayawardene stepped down from the captaincy. ",
            "He made his comeback in 2017, and took a six-for against India in an ODI that year, and another against South Africa in 2018. In between he made a successful entry into Test cricket, taking four five-wicket hauls in his first six Tests.",
            "In September 2019, Dananjaya was banned from bowling in international cricket for 12 months because of an illegal bowling action. His return was dramatic - in a T20I in Antigua in March 2021, he took a hat-trick in one over but was carted for six sixes by Kieron Pollard in his next. "

            "Tom Curran is a slick fast bowler with a deadly yorker, whose impressive performances as a youngster for Surrey quickly saw him earn international recognition as he debuted for England in all three formats as a 22-year-old.",
            "After playing a handful of white-ball games during the 2017 home summer, he was brought into England's squad for the 2017-18 Ashes after an injury to Steve Finn, and performed creditably despite an eventual lack of wickets. His white-ball form continued, as he starred in an ODI in Perth immediately after those Tests, taking 5 for 35 to close out a narrow win, and he earned an IPL deal with Kolkata Knight Riders for 2018. ",
            "He remained around the international setup for the next 18 months, and was named in the 50-over World Cup squad for 2019 after edging out David Willey, but didn't manage to get on the field; his short-form performances suggested that the T20 World Cups in the coming years would be his opportunity to star. That didn't happen; he was left out of both 2021 and 2022 tournaments. In February 2023, he made the decision to take an indefinite break from all red ball cricket - this after registering a maiden first class century during the previous summer while playing for Surrey against Northamptonshire, the county his father, Kevin, served. A month later he reported pain in his lower back while turning out for Islamabad United in the PSL. Scans revealed he had succumbed to a stress fracture for the second time in as many years. ",
            "Curran, the older brother of Ben and Sam, had a breakout summer for Surrey in 2015, as they won promotion in the County Championship and reached the final of the Blast. His ponytail didn't last long, as coach Alec Stewart convinced him to get rid of it before the photographers recorded the young player of the year awards at the end of the season. He took the most wickets in Division Two , with 76, and were the joint-most in a Championship season for Surrey since Waqar Younis' 113 in 1991.",
            "The step up to Division One proved harder than anticipated, as he took on a workhorse role on some flat pitches at The Oval, but he earned selection for an England Lions tour alongside Sam at the end of the season. ",
            "Having grown up in Cape Town, Tom Curran was spotted by former Surrey captain Ian Greig while playing schools cricket. He was invited to play Second XI cricket for Surrey in 2012, at the age of 17, and took 5 for 21 against Kent in his second game. He also began at Wellington School in September 2012. A month later, tragedy struck when his father, the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin, died suddenly. But Curran decided to remain at Wellington, helped by the school offering his two younger brothers the chance to study there too."

Haq immediately celebrated by taking his maiden ODI five-wicket haul in a victory over Ireland. It was fitting reward for more than a decade's sterling service, during which Haq has established himself as one of the craftiest spinners beyond the Test world.

He has since reverted to being a useful lower-order batsman, and hit his maiden first-class century in the Intercontinental Cup match against the Netherlands in 2011. "

            "Boyd Rankin first came to prominence as part of the Ireland team that progressed to the Super Eight section of the 2007 World Cup. Blessed with great height - Rankin is six feet, seven inches tall - he gained bounce from even the most sluggish of surfaces and claimed 12 wickets in the tournament to help his side to notable victories over Pakistan and Bangladesh. Five years later, he made himself unavailable for Ireland in a bid to play Test cricket with England. The move provoked disquiet in his home country but it appeared to have been justified when he was named in England's Ashes squad to tour Australia in 2013-14, after a series of impressive limited-overs displays for his adoptive country. Progress was fitful, though, and he restored his allegiance with Ireland as 2015 drew to a close.",
            "Having spent some time on the staff at Middlesex without ever making it into the first team, Rankin broke into the Derbyshire side on the back of his World Cup success and then moved to Warwickshire at the end of the 2007 season. Hampered by a succession of injuries, it wasn't until 2009 that, having put greater onus on strength and fitness, he began to fulfil his potential. In 2011 he was part of the Ireland side that defeated England in the World Cup game in Bangalore and then passed 50 first-class wickets in a county season for the first time. After one particularly hostile spell in which he struck Marcus Trescothick several times on the body, the Somerset opener praised Rankin for being as good a fast bowler as he faced that season. While consistency and fitness remained an issue, there was little doubt that, when the force was with him, Rankin had the pace, bounce and lateral movement to discomfort any batsman.",
            "Rankin made his England Lions debut in 2011 against Sri Lanka A and was selected on the England Performance Programme later that same year. He came very close to being called-up to the Test squad at the start of 2012 when Chris Tremlett was forced out of the series in the UAE due to injury, but was unavailable due to fitness issues of his own.",
            "After 37 ODIs and 15 T20Is, he retired from Irish cricket towards the end of 2012 in order to concentrate on winning a place in the England Test side. Having struggled to remain injury free, it was made clear to him that his body could not sustain the burden of playing all formats of the game for Ireland, Warwickshire and England Lions. It was also made clear to him by his then club coach, Ashley Giles, that he would not be guaranteed another county contract unless he committed to Warwickshire and England.",
            "After impressing at the start of 2013, Rankin was called into the England squad for the ODI series against New Zealand following injuries to Stuart Broad and Steven Finn. In June that year he played his first game for England, a Twenty20 international against New Zealand. His England ODI debut followed shortly after, ironically in Dublin, where Rankin took a career-best 4 for 46 against his former country, and his returns during the one-day series with Australia were good enough to win him a place in the Ashes squad.",
            "The tour did not go as he would have wished. Overlooked until the final Test, Rankin delivered a nervous performance on Test debut that raised questions about both his temperament and the environment within the England squad. He later revealed that he played the game carrying an injury. He was subsequently omitted from England World T20 squad, but thrown a lifeline latter in the year when he was recalled to the Lions squad for the tour of South Africa. It was a selection that ended any realistic hopes Ireland had of persuading him to return to them for the 2015 World Cup. They had, until then, retained hopes of the ICC providing special dispensation for a speedy return."

            "Alastair Cook was never an especially elegant batter, but his determination, his longevity and the sheer number of runs he made cemented his position as one of England's greatest. As the Oval crowd in his final Test stood to give him ovation after ovation, his popularity and the respect he evoked were abundantly clear. A knighthood followed a few months later. ",
            "By the time he played his final Test, aged only 33, he was already England's highest run-scorer and century-maker in Test cricket; had taken the most catches (as a non-keeper) for England; and had set a world record for the most Test caps in succession: an eye-watering 159.",
            "He scored 766 runs in seven innings in the 2010-11 Ashes to anchor England's first series win in Australia for 24 years. Two years later he became England's leading Test century-maker - hitting No. 23 against India in Kolkata, his third in three matches - and the youngest player to pass 7000 runs. ",
            "The series victory in India that hundred contributed to was England's first there for 28 years. Two home Ashes wins followed for Cook, in 2013 and 2015, and in the winter of 2015-16, a triumphant tour of South Africa.",
            "But there were significant disappointments too. He captained the side that was whitewashed in the 2013-14 Ashes and beaten by Sri Lanka at home the following summer. While he led the team to within an ace of that elusive global ODI title at the Champions Trophy of 2013, he was omitted from the 2015 World Cup squad, ending his limited-overs career around his 30th birthday.",
            "Cook's leadership was, in many ways, like his batting: unyielding, determined and deliberate, but lacking the spark of tactical genius. His 24 Test wins in 59 Tests made him one of the most successful England captains, but his 22 defeats were also a record then. He resigned as Test captain in the aftermath of a 4-0 trouncing by India in 2016.",
            "A batting prodigy since his school days, Cook was first called up to the Test side in 2006 as an injury replacement during a tour of India. He had been in the Caribbean with the A team when the SOS came but, unfazed, he stroked 60 and a magnificent century to complete a memorable debut in Nagpur. His ability to play long, attritional innings without showing signs of fatigue - it became a cliché that he did not sweat - was evident from the outset.",
            "By his 25th birthday, he had scored far more runs and centuries than any other Englishman of a comparable age. He hit three Test hundreds in 2009 - but none of them were in the Ashes series, in which 95 at Lord's was his only score above 32 as the Aussies probed at his front-pad problem. The Pakistan attack of 2010 caused more problems, but a gritty century at The Oval ensured Cook would open in the Ashes series in which he proved so decisive. It's probably a fair microcosm of his career: he never claimed to be the most talented, but somehow he found a way. \n"

As wicketkeeper and an effective middle-order batsman, he found success in all three formats and won a place in the New Zealand XI in 2009 in the home series against India. Later that year, he set a domestic wicketkeeping record, effecting 12 dismissals in a Plunket Shield game against Central Districts. Incidentally, it was also a wicketkeeping record for most catches in a first-class game - he took six in each innings. McGlashan was named in the 30-man preliminary squad for the World Twenty20 in 2012, but decided to retire from all cricket in July that year, choosing a career outside of cricket with a foundation geared towards eliminating domestic violence."

            "Discovered as a 14-year-old by then Nepal coach Pubudu Dassanayake during a pit stop in the remote Chitwan Province on the way from Kathmandu to left-arm spinner Basant Regmi's wedding, Sandeep Lamichhane has continued to make the most of good fortune at every opportunity to come his way.",
            "\nSerendipitous Sandy made his unofficial senior team debut as a 15-year-old in November 2015 against a touring MCC squad. Hong Kong wicketkeeper Scott McKechnie, playing for the MCC, was dismissed twice by Lamichhane, prompting him to recruit the young legspinner to play for Kowloon Cantons at the inaugural Hong Kong T20 Blitz in May 2016. It was there that Lamichhane crossed paths with former Australia captain Michael Clarke, who observed enough of Lamichhane's talent to extend an invite to come to Sydney for the following Australian summer playing club cricket under Clarke's watchful eye.",
            "\nLamichhane's first foray on the international stage came at the 2016 Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh where he was Nepal's leading wicket-taker with 14 in six games including a five-for against Ireland. Not long after, he made his senior-team debut against Namibia in the WCL Championship and was a regular throughout the rest of the tournament, proving himself a major asset as a result of his impressive accuracy for a young wristspinner.",
            " \nBy January 2018, Lamichhane had cemented his status as a rising star within the Nepal set-up. But his fame grew exponentially when, at age 17, he became the first player from his country snapped up at the IPL auction, fetching a bid of INR 20 lakh (USD 31,000 approx) from Delhi Daredevils. He justified that hoopla the following month with 17 wickets in a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at 2018 WCL Division Two in Namibia, propelling Nepal into the World Cup Qualifier for only the second time ever.",
            "\nIn March 2018, he became the first Nepal player to be drafted in the CPL as well, taken in round 13 by St Kitts & Nevis Patriots, adding to the list of history-making accomplishments on his growing resume. Still just a teenager, Lamichhane may have plenty more pages yet to be written.  "

            "Phil Mustard, a character cricketer much loved by Durham supporters, was for a time touted as a solution to England's search for a wicketkeeper with batting dash in one-day cricket. Sporadic comparisons with Australia's Adam Gilchrist were understandable - both were left-handed wicketkeeper-batsmen capable of savaging an attack - and while nobody, not least himself, ever claimed he would reach the same heights, at his best he had a simple eye for destruction and was always eminently watchable. He was also more resilient than might have been imagined for such a socially relaxed individual: nobody had played more first-class games for Durham until Paul Collingwood overtook him.",
            "Mustard, a former England U-19, enjoyed a superb 2007 as Durham won their first two trophies, scoring 893 List A runs at 49.61, including a breezy 49 in the county's first Lord's final. Off the back of such a successful summer, he was called up to replace the injured Matt Prior for England's one-day series against Sri Lanka in October 2007. And although he kept beautifully, his highest score opening the batting was 28. He was still named as back-up keeper to Prior for the subsequent Test series in Sri Lanka and again acted as understudy during the New Zealand Tests, this time to Tim Ambrose. In the ODI series that followed Mustard returned to the side and finally made his mark with 83 from 74 balls in a dramatic tied game in Napier. But one half-century was not enough to retain his place for that summer's ODIs as Ambrose kept against New Zealand and Prior returned for the South Africa series.",
            "The subsequent emergence of Craig Kieswetter, followed by many others, put an end to his England hopes but domestically, Mustard continued to perform in domestic one-day cricket with distinction. In first-class cricket, Mustard did not produce the consistent performances he managed in the limited-overs formats",
            "Captaincy had rarely been on his mind, but Durham turned to him early in the 2010 season when Will Smith, a good tactician whose authority was undermined by slim personal returns with the bat, was persuaded to resign during a coach journey north from a heavy defeat at Trent Bridge. Mustard, known universally as The Colonel after the character in the Cluedo board game, averaged close to 40 again and more importantly steadied the ship as Durham finished fifth in the County Championship.",
            "2011 was his first full year as four-day captain (Dale Benkenstein took over the one-day role) and Mustard enjoyed a fine campaign, scoring 716 runs at 51.14 as Durham looked strong favourites for a third title in four seasons. But, coupled with a turn in the north-eastern weather, their challenge faded towards the end of the season as Twenty20 quarter-final and CB40 semi-final defeats added to the disappointment.",
            "And the poor form ran into 2012 as Durham endured a disastrous first-half to the season and, rooted to the bottom of the table, Paul Collingwood took over as captain. He conjured a miraculous recovery that led Durham to the safety of mid-table but Mustard returned the second-worst figures of his career with 482 runs at just 21.90 with one half-century. He was more like his old self as Durham won the title the following summer and even took his first first-class wicket in a lighthearted finish to the season when he trapped the England one-day batsman, Luke Wright, lbw with a quicker-slower one. When his form declined markedly in 2015, he briefly answered Lancashire's urgent need for a keeper with a short loan deal. Gloucestershire also enticed him on loan in 2016 and, as Durham signalled that he would be released, successfully offered him a two-year deal at the end of the season. When Gareth Roderick missed the start of 2017 because of illness, much to his surprise he even found hmself captain again.",
            "Mustard also played Twenty20 cricket abroad in the off season. He represented Barisal Burners in the Bangladesh Premier League and Mountaineers in Zimbabwe in the 2011-12 season, scoring 56 in the final to help the latter win their domestic title. He had hoped to play in the Pakistan Premier League, but Durham refused to endorse a No Objections Certificate amid concerns over security.",
            "A talented all-round sportsman, Mustard was at Manchester United for two years until he was 13 and then with Middlesbrough until he was 15. "

            "Mohammad Amir, a left-arm pace bowler, reveres Wasim Akram. Over 2007 and 2008, he also emerged, still improbably young, as a hot pace prospect. Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing. ",
            "He began in 2009 with an impressive showing on the domestic circuit, impressing with his whippy pace and swing. He took 55 wickets for National Bank of Pakistan in his debut season, and earned selection to the Pakistan World T20 squad. There he hit the big time, taking over from an out-of-sorts Sohail Tanvir and bowling with pace, accuracy and courage. ",
            "He hovered in the high 80mphs, touching even 90 on occasion and was a crucial opening link in Pakistan's title run. He bowled several nerveless final overs and one absolutely crucial opening over, in the final, when he dismissed tournament top-scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan for a five-ball duck, peppering him with quick, short balls. He carried his form over to the ODI version, picking up match-winning figures of 4 for 28 against Sri Lanka in August before turning in consistent spells in the Champions Trophy. ",
            "He picked six wickets on Test debut in Sri Lanka. Thereafter, over tours to New Zealand, Australia and England, he matured remarkably, building up his pace and both new-ball and reverse swing. The 2010 tour of England saw the best of him and he became the youngest bowler, at 18, to take 50 Test wickets. But his world crashed around him when he was implicated in a spot-fixing scam in which it was alleged that he had bowled deliberate, pre-planned no-balls in a Test. In February 2011 he was handed a five-year ban following investigations by an ICC tribunal. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to six months in prison at Southwark Crown Court.",
            "After his release, Amir frequently expressed his contrition over the incident and co-operated with the ICC in spreading its anti-corruption message. Having been cleared to return to all forms of cricket in September 2015, he made his international comeback the following January, as part of Pakistan's limited-overs squad to New Zealand. On his next international assignment, the 20-over Asia Cup in Dhaka, he made waves once again, rattling India's top order with three wickets in a hostile spell of pace bowling. Amir's reintegration came full circle when he was selected in the Test squad for England later that year, setting up a comeback Test at Lord's, the venue where the spot-fixing scandal had derailed his career six years before.",
            "However, it is in Test cricket, the format supposedly perfectly designed for him to express his wizardry, that he has disappointed most profoundly. Magical spells with the new ball have been all too fleeting, and his performances in the three countries where conditions are arguably best suited to him, have been largely indifferent. With the ball, he averaged 42.41 in England in 2016, 28.83 in New Zealand that same year, and 61.60 when Australia whitewashed Pakistan at the turn of the year. The prodigious banana swing from that titillating left-arm angle - and that quite beautiful bowling action - does come, but not nearly as potently or regularly as memory suggests it did in his teenage years. In other words, Amir, in Test cricket, has flattered to deceive. "

He is one of the very few professional cricketers to hail from that part of the country, so he had done well enough to make it to the age-group sides. However, the next step became arduous. He didn't have a regular place in the Dhaka Division, so when he was picked by Comilla Victorians for the 2015 Bangladesh Premier League, nobody really recognised him.",
            "But 22 wickets in his first outing in the BPL in 2015 put him on the map. Hider started off the haul with Kumar Sangakkara's wicket and went on to remove the likes of Mahmudullah and Soumya Sarkar during this breakthrough performance.",
            "His pace and yorkers were quite noticeable, drawing the attention of the selectors who picked for three T20 tournaments at the start of 2016. Hider took three wickets in five games during that period, and went on to lose his place from the Bangladesh T20 side. He is a regular in domestic cricket, and remains in the selectors' radar for his pace.  "

There are people who would travel miles to see his wristwork which produces strokeplay steeped in élan. But for all his elegance as a batsman, he has underperformed mightily with an international batting average below 20 over the better part of a decade.",
            "The promise of a luminous career began in 2002 when, in his first year at the highest level, Kapali carved an unbeaten 89 in an ODI against West Indies, followed by two more half-centuries in the Tests in the next two weeks. It had the Brian Lara-esque pulls, wristy flicks and the daring drives on the off-side.",
            "An indifferent 2003 World Cup was hardly a warning sign, but his laziness in footwork should have been worked at. Instead, he struck 71 against South Africa and followed it up with two half-centuries and a Test hat-trick (the first by a Bangladeshi) against Pakistan. But in the next four years, Kapali only had a 55 against Kenya to show for as his career dwindled. Part of the problem was missing too many first-class matches for Sylhet, who also suffered due to his absence. Maybe Kapali isn't to blame for the scheduling of international matches, but a more practical approach could have helped his cricket.",
            "He struck a century against India in an Asia Cup match in June 2008, but within months would take a hiatus from Bangladesh cricket by signing up with the rebel Indian Cricket League. There he scored the first century of the tournament, a 60-ball 100 in Hyderabad that won him a scooter. But the novelty wore off as the players from Dhaka Gladiators lost fans for choosing club over country. They were banned by the BCB before he quit the ICL and was available for selection."

An ODI debut against Pakistan also followed by the end of the summer, and the winter brought a Test debut in Chennai, where he made a dogged, unbeaten 66 batting at No. 8.",
            "A former England U-19 captain, Dawson made his maiden first-class century at 18, becoming the youngest player to score a hundred for Hampshire. He initially developed as a top-order batter who provided useful left-arm spin as a supplement, but went on to be known more for his bowling than his batting as his career progressed. ",
            "Dawson took 7 for 51 on his debut for Mountaineers in Zimbabwe in 2011, and the next summer, back in England, hit the headlines by dismissing Kevin Pietersen for two golden ducks - in a 40-over game and a T20. That year he took nine wickets at 24.22 in Hampshire's title win in the T20 competition, and a year later, 13 at 21.30, though they only made it as far as the semi-finals this time. ",
            "Dawson put up over 1000 first-class runs for the first time in 2013. In 2016 came England debuts in T20I and ODI cricket, and though he was initially overlooked for the Test tours of Bangladesh and India, he flew in midway as an injury replacement and made his debut in Chennai.",
            "Lord's against South Africa the following year was his next call - where he took four wickets and made a pair. One more Test, in that same series, where he failed with bat and ball and that was his Test career done.",
            "Dawson's excellent T20 form for Hampshire in 2018 won him a place on England's one-day tour to Sri Lanka, where he played two ODIs to no great effect. In 2019, he averaged 54 with the bat and took 14 wickets as Hampshire finished third in the County Championship. His next white-ball excursion for England came in 2022, when he went on tours of West Indies, Pakistan and Australia.",
            "The following season was his annus mirabilis in the Championship: 49 wickets and 840 runs from 14 games, helping fetch Hampshire eight wins, as many as title winners Surrey, and third place on the table. By then, Dawson was acknowledged to be one of the club's most versatile and prolific players, having made over 13,000 runs and taken 500-plus wickets across formats for them in his first 15 years with them.\n"

Sohag Gazi is the rare specialist offspinner who grew up right by the Bay of Bengal, and has travelled the length and breadth of the country to be recognised as one of the promising slow bowlers in Bangladesh. His run-up is short, even by spinners' standards, but his bowling action itself is a whir, followed by a tight follow-through.",

He played till his mid-teens in Khulna, before shuttling along the south, playing in the various leagues in Khulna and neighboring Barisal Division. He first made a name for himself in the first division Cricket League, the second tier of the capital's league structure, for Orient Sporting Club, and made his first-class debut in the 2009-10 season, starting off with a five-wicket haul against Chittagong Division. The following season he was the highest wicket-taker in the National Cricket League, taking 41 wickets.",
            "The call-up to the National Cricket Academy and the Bangladesh A team followed. He did well in the West Indies for the A team and against other second-string sides but he faced a few dark months in 2012 when an umpire at the Shafi Darashah tournament in Bangalore reported him for a kink in his elbow while bowling the quicker delivery. He went through the usual checks before being given the green signal to play first-class cricket in the 2012-13 season, one which he started off with nine wickets. A seven-wicket haul in the second innings included a hattrick, and spectacularly, Sohag slammed a hundred in the same game, becoming only the thirteenth cricketer of all time to score a century and take a hattrick in a first-class match."

At the time of making his international debut, Senanayake had already taken 297 first-class wickets from 59 matches at a fantastic average of 20.50, and 107 List A wickets at an economy rate of 3.90. In the 2010-11 season, he was the fourth-highest wicket-taker in Tier A of the Premier League tournament, taking 45 wickets in eight matches at 15.17. He has also shown that he can handle the pressure of limited-over matches: in the 2011-12 Premier Limited-Over tournament, Sri Lanka's main one-day competition, he was the highest wicket-taker with 16 in six games at 11.18.",
            "Senanayake's first foray into international cricket was short-lived though, and after several mediocre performances, he was released back into the domestic fold, where he continued to excel. He came back into international focus when he was bought for $650,000 by the Kolkata Knight Riders IPL franchise in 2013, largely owing to his reputation of possessing one of the better carrom balls in Sri Lanka. ",
            "It turned out to be a good year for him, as he also put in a strong showing in the first-class competition, made a Test debut for Sri Lanka against Pakistan in December, and also had an extended run in the one-day team. He had mixed fortunes in the ODI series against England in June 2014 - remarkable figures of 4 for 13 that skittled England out for 99 were offset by news of his action being reported as suspect. ",
            "While the controversy didn't stop him from being at the centre of a tense series win for Sri Lanka - he was also involved in a Mankading incident against Jos Buttler in the decider - he was dealt a big blow when his action was found to be illegal in July.  Senanayake remodeled his action and returned to international cricket in December 2014. "

            "With his wide grin, zooming flipper and hard-to-pick wrong'un, Brad Hogg was Australia's most mercurial left-arm wristspinner since Chuck Fleetwood-Smith in the 1930s. ",
            "Hogg, who began first-class life as a solid left-hand batter before flirting with wristspin in the nets one afternoon at the playful suggestion of his Western Australia coach Tony Mann, announced himself to the world with a stupendous flipper that bowled Zimbabwe's Andy Flower in the 2003 World Cup. Until then Hogg's cricketing trajectory had been anything but straightforward. Like Stuart MacGill, he had spent years in the shadow of Shane Warne. He got a chance at that World Cup only because Warne was banned for taking a diuretic. Hogg's first Test opportunity, in Delhi way back in 1996, also arose as a chance to stand in for Warne. He made 1 and 4, took 1 for 69, and was promptly dumped for the next seven years and 78 games. ",
            "In April 2006 he passed 100 ODI wickets and was Player of the Series against Bangladesh, but he was used strangely at home the following season after playing in the final of the Champions Trophy. Called on only once during the CB Series preliminary rounds, he was even released for domestic matches and seemed to be on the verge of exiting the national set-up, but Cameron White's disappointing bowling turned the selectors back to Hogg, who then failed to get a wicket in the next five games. However, at the 2007 World Cup, he was destructive, taking 21 wickets at 15.80. ",
            "He struggled again when given chances in the Test series against India, his eight wickets costing almost 60 apiece. Still, his decision to retire at the end of the 2007-08 summer caught many on the hop. His decision to come back was just as unexpected, as was the fact that his career continued till close to his 47th birthday. After a brief stint as a commentator, he returned to play grade cricket in Perth. That led to a surprise call-up for Perth Scorchers in the 2011-12 BBL, and at 40, a recall to the national T20I squad. Then came a stint in the IPL for Rajasthan Royals, where he took ten wickets in nine games and went at just over seven runs an over in his first IPL season. In 2015, his nine wickets for Kolkata Knight Riders came at just 16 apiece, and his economy rate was below seven. ",
            "Hogg used to be a postman - \"I do my round like a Formula One driver,\" he once bragged - and has the ever-present smile of a postie who has never known yappy dogs or rainy days.\n"

            "Tall and muscular, Kyle Jarvis is equipped with raw pace. The son of former Zimbabwe player, Malcolm Jarvis, Jarvis was the chief strike bowler for Zimbabwe at the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, and was fast-tracked into the national side after the appointment of Heath Streak as bowling coach. Jarvis was blooded in the home series against Kenya, and in this and subsequent one-day series in Bangladesh and South Africa, he impressed many with his pace, touching 145kph at times. He lacked control, however, and tended to be expensive, although he continued to pick up wickets. Jarvis made his first-class debut in an Intercontinental Cup game against Kenya in October 2009, and took 6 for 60 in his first Logan Cup game for the Mashonaland Eagles. Jarvis was included in Zimbabwe's squad for the tour of the West Indies in 2009-10, but withdrew from the tour with a stress fracture of the lower back. A keen sportsman, he has also played rugby for the Zimbabwe U-19s. His comeback to international cricket coincided with Zimbabwe's return to the Test fold. He debuted in his country's first Test in almost six years, which was against Bangladesh in Harare in August 2011.",
            "Expectations of a successful international career were shelved when he quit Zimbabwe cricket two years later to play county cricket. He said his international retirement was spurred on by a salary dispute with the board in August 2013 that forced the players to briefly go on strike and set up a union. His destination was Lancashire and, after an unproductive first season, he rediscovered much of his menace the following season, taking 62 Championship wickets as Lancashire won promotion and on course to be the division's leading wicket-taker until a broken hand prematurely ended his season. He stood up well to first division life, too, in 2016, leading Lancashire's wickets tally once more with 51 and described by his coach, Ashley Giles, as \"lethal\" as his six wickets against Surrey briefly shot Lancashire to the top of the table."

His 24 first-class wickets that season and the World Cup performance saw him fast-tracked into the Test side; he debuted against India at Gros Islet in August 2016 and bounced out Virat Kohli for 3 for his first wicket. His ODI debut came a few months later, against Pakistan in Sharjah. ",

            "- Before the start of IPL 2024, Chahar sat at No. 5 on CSK's list of all-time top wicket-takers, with 71 wickets in 68 games at a strike rate of 20.5.",
            "- IPL 2019 was Chahar's best season, when he picked 22 wickets in 17 matches finishing third on No. 3 on the Purple Cap list. ",
            "- Chahar was the second-most expensive buy at the mega auction ahead of IPL 2022, with CSK buying him back for INR 14 crore. A back injury, however, ruled him out of the entire season.",
            "- Chahar has been a three-time IPL winner with CSK in 2018, 2021 and 2023.",
            "Deepak Chahar player profile",
            "Deepak Chahar is a classical swing bowler who added T20 smarts to his game to pick up 6 for 7 against Bangladesh in 2019, then the best bowling figures in T20Is. ",
            "After making a sensational first-class cricket debut for Rajasthan in 2010-11, taking 8 for 10 in Hyderabad's 21 all out, Chahar struggled with injuries and fitness. He then rediscovered himself as a T20 bowler, blossoming under the captaincy of MS Dhoni in Chennai Super Kings' triumphant return to the IPL in 2018. He did even better next season, finishing third on the wickets table, with 22 at a strike rate of 17.5, including 3 for 26 in the final. Super Kings paid US$1.8 million to keep him at the 2022 auction. However, a back injury ruled him out of that season's IPL and from the T20 World Cup, for which he was in the reserves, later in the year.",
            "A bowler in the mould of Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Chahar learned swing bowling at his father's coaching academy. Dhoni used him shrewdly with the new ball, often bowling him for three overs in the powerplay. Chahar also kept working on his other skills and turned himself into a capable bowler at the death, which was evident in that record-breaking spell against Bangladesh: four of his six wickets, including a hat-trick, came with a wet old ball in dewy conditions.",
            "Chahar is also a handy lower-order batter. In an ODI in Colombo in July 2021, he steered India's chase with an unbeaten 69 from No. 8.\n"

Scores of 117 against Sri Lanka A and a double-hundred five days later in the domestic first-class tournament gave the selectors enough reason to pick him in the Test squad to play India, but he could not debut as expected in the second Test after injuring his right hand while taking a superb catch at gully as a substitute fielder in the first. ",
            "He made his Test debut in February 2020, against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. It was the realisation of a belief held by some coaches in the BCB who had felt, since 2015, the year of Saif's Under-19 debut, that he would one day open the batting with Tamim Iqbal. ",

Saif stuck at it and made his way through the age-group structure. What always stood out was his languid strokeplay - he once hit ten sixes in a Dhaka league match. "

Little more than 6ft tall, with a smooth and athletic run-up, his fast arm surprises batsmen and he has a natural full-of-a-length delivery, swinging the ball both ways at pace. A reasonable tailender and with excellent hands in the outfield, Hassan - softly spoken yet fiercely ambitious - represents the talent which exists in Afghanistan.",
            "The match at Lord's was a significant step for a bowler whose family fled the bombs of Jalalabad when he was six, and who subsequently learned the game in Peshawar where thousands of his countrymen sought refuge. His family, all of whom hated the game, did their best to encourage education but Hassan's determination - he played the game in secret for years - eventually won them over. He was first spotted when playing for Afghanistan in March 2006 in Mumbai when they defeated an MCC side led by Mike Gatting, where the then MCC president, Robin Marlar, noticed his potential, and was stunned to see him bowling in flat trainers. Hasan toured England with the national side in 2006, playing several matches against county second XIs, winning them all and was drafted onto MCC's groundstaff where he bowled against his hero, Andrew Flintoff, and was quick enough to smash Monty Panesar's helmet in the nets.",
            "He ventured north to play for Norden CC in the Central Lancashire League the following year and represented Afghanistan in the 2009 World Cup Qualifiers, where his whippy action on a corrugated pitch earned him his first five-wicket haul, helping his side upset the tournament favourites Ireland. His once apathetic family celebrated back home by sacrificing a lamb and handing it around the small village to poor people."

Square and behind it on the off side are his areas, where his game is the most enchanting.",

Until 2005, as Yousuf Youhana, he was only the fourth Christian to have played for Pakistan, and easily the most successful. He converted publicly to Islam late that year, after which he became a great Pakistani batsman and briefly part of as formidable a middle order as the country has seen, with Younis Khan and Inzamam-ul-Haq on either side. At least he believes there to be a link, and statistics would back that up.",

Over 11 Tests, he scored 1788 runs with nine hundreds, breaking Sir Viv Richards' 30-year-old record. If there had been a nagging doubt that he often withered when the heat was on - and the story of his rise from extremely humble backgrounds as a member of a minority religion should've wiped those away anyway - it was erased here."

            "The first thing that strikes you about Kyle Jamieson is his height. At 6'8\", he is one of the tallest fast bowlers in the circuit. And like most people who send a cricket ball down from such awkward heights, he is known for getting awkward bounce. So much so that batsmen forget that he has a phenomenal fuller delivery. Especially when it starts to hoop in at the stumps. ",
            "Jamieson was born and bred in Auckland. He even plays domestic cricket for them now, but it was during his time at Canterbury that he first rose to the national spotlight. The right-arm quick, playing in the 2019 Super Smash, picked up 6 for 7 in four overs. Those figures are a New Zealand T20 record, and they have been bettered by only three men in the entire world. ",
            "Jamieson made his international debut in February 2020 against India and was one of the key players in an incredibly close match at Eden Park. He has since been viewed as an asset for New Zealand in all forms of cricket and has been especially potent in Test matches. He took two five-fors in his first four matches and has also shown a lot of competence with the bat as well. Although he has only begun his career, the heights he might reach already look scary. \n"

            "Heino Kuhn joined the exodus from South Africa into county cricket when he was told by Cricket South Africa that, at 33, he was unlikely to gain further opportunities at international level. He took a Kolpak deal with Kent ahead of the 2018 season and displayed an ambition that suggested his career was far from spent.",
            "Kuhn proved to be an inspired signing as his will to win permeated the Kent dressing room in a summer where they won promotion to Division One for the first time in 11 years and were beaten finalists in the Royal London Cup. He missed out on a century in a consistent Championship season, but he was unstoppable in 50-over cricket as he struck four hundreds in five innings, all of them meticulously judged. In tears when he was out for 127 against Worcestershire in the semi-final because he had not quite guided Kent home, he was soon cheering victory.",
            "That heartfelt dedication to the cause resulted in Kuhn being named interim Kent captain while regular team leaders Sam Billings and Joe Denly played in the IPL. He extended his tenure when, with Billings sidelined by a dislocated shoulder, he offered to take the reins and allow Denly to pursue a Test recall by concentrating on his batting. For a second year running, Kuhn missed out on a first-class century and had to settle for five fifties. Kuhn had a fairly modest year all-round with the bat but he scooped back-to-back Fielder of the Year honours in Kent's annual awards with 23 catches across all formats.",
            "Kuhn had received a South Africa call up on the 2017 tour of England, after 12 years' domestic cricket experience in South Africa, but he struggled on English pitches, his international career ending with four Test caps and seven T20Is and without a single half-century.",
            "A wicketkeeper-batsman, Kuhn first played for the Titans from 2004-05 and for much of that time he cemented his place as their first-choice gloveman. Kuhn's batting undoubtedly worked in his favour. With a good record in all three forms of the game, Kuhn was the second-highest run-scorer in the 2006-07 SuperSport Series with 776 runs at 48.50, and his century against the Dolphins helped the Titans claim the SuperSport title that season."

His bowling was stronger than his batting during the initial stages but he had the ability to hit the ball cleanly. He was an integral part of Sri Lanka's Under-19 World Cup squad in 2000 and his 12 wickets at an average of 13 apiece help fast track his progress to the senior team. Weeraratne made his ODI debut in the Asia Cup in 2000. However, poor form and injury resulted in Weeraratne failing to cement his place in the team and he spent nearly five years on the sidelines after his 11th ODI in 2003. He forced himself back into reckoning after successfully remodeling his action and scored a blistering half-century off 12 balls, which was the fastest fifty in one-day cricket, during a domestic match in 2005. He received a call up to the national squad for the tour of the West Indies and the Asia Cup in 2008."

            "Rated as one half of the best new-ball pair in New Zealand history by Sir Richard Hadlee, Trent Boult is a left-arm quick who presents a significant threat to batsmen around the world with an ability to move the ball both ways even in unresponsive conditions.",
            "Born in the Bay of Plenty region in New Zealand's North Island, Boult is, in the words of his brother Jono, a \"normal sort of Kiwi young guy… into his golf and fishing and surfing.\" Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighbourhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded. Signs of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year-old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.",
            "The transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand's irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side's march to their first World Cup final in 2015. ",
            "Boult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn't move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand's top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL.",
            "Boult's strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, \"he's got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control.\" Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side's most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. ",
            "The pair have both raced past 200 Test wickets and by 2019 occupy third and fourth on New Zealand's all-time Test wicket-taking list behind Hadlee and Daniel Vettori. Boult was again magnificent in the 2019 World Cup helping lead New Zealand's attack taking 17 wickets. He took a hat-trick against Australia, and the key wicket of Virat Kohli in the semi-final win over India. He bowled the last over and the Super Over in the tied final against England and without some misfortune he may have won the World Cup for his nation. "

            "A wicketkeeper-batsman who was next in line behind Brad Haddin as far back as 2009, his career was almost ended by a finger injury that required multiple operations. Paine originally broke his right index finger in November 2010, when he was struck on the hand by a Dirk Nannes delivery while batting in an Australian Cricketers' Association All-Stars T20 match, and it caused him considerable problems over the next few years. It was extremely unfortunate timing for Paine. He was the ODI wicketkeeper and opening batsman in Australia's Champions Trophy triumph in 2009 and played four Tests in 2010 against Pakistan and India. Although Paine subsequently appeared in a few ODIs and T20s, he spent nearly six years out of the national set-up before being recalled in February 2017 for a T20 series against Sri Lanka.",

In first-class cricket he suffered from a lack of hundreds -the 215 that he scored while playing as a specialist batsman in his fifth Sheffield Shield game, back in October 2006, was his only first-class century until late 2019. A respected leader who often captained Tasmania, Paine also led Hobart Hurricanes, and it was ultimately through T20 that his return to international cricket finally arrived."

        "bio": [
            "A hulking allrounder who combines right-arm fast-medium bowling with strong lower-order batting, John Hastings became Australia's 430th Test cricketer when Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus were ruled out of the Perth Test against South Africa in 2012-13. Hastings took the wicket of AB de Villiers in the first innings and made contributions with the bat, but his bowling generally lacked the penetration required to seriously trouble a strong South African line-up. ",
            "A consistent Sheffield Shield performer for Victoria, Hastings took 27 wickets at 24.51 in the 2012-13 season and another 27 at 25.00 the following summer. That was enough to interest Durham and Hastings' workmanlike qualities meant he took to the grind of county cricket successfully, so much so that he won a recall to Australia's one-day squad against England in 2015 as the selectors combed county cricket to cover for a spate of injuries. He was not just conveniently placed, he was in impressive form, too, an ever-present for Durham in all three competitions until his call up, and allying dangerous lower-order hitting to his solid seam bowling. After a four-year gap, he played in Leeds and Manchester, adding to the 11 caps he had won earlier.",
            "Hastings' first two names - John Wayne - invited people to call him the Duke and New South Wales watched him ride into the Victorian sunset at the end of 2006-07 as he could not find a way into the Blues line-up. His breakthrough season came in 2009-10 when he was Victoria's leading wicket-taker in all three competitions and played in the final in all three formats. Not surprisingly, he was named the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year. In addition to his 36 Shield wickets he contributed 446 runs at 37.16, highlighting his value as an all-round option and confirming that Victoria had done the right thing by signing him up. ",
            "He made his ODI debut in India in 2010 and his T20 debut in the same season, and was part of Australia's 2011 World Cup squad, although he did not play a game. A serious shoulder injury sidelined him for the entire 2011-12 season, but he came back well the next summer and was Victoria's leading Ryobi Cup wicket-taker.",
            "A muscular man at 196 centimetres and 100 kilograms, Hastings is a remarkably canny bowler who relies on outsmarting batsmen rather than genuine pace. Less surprising is the fact that Hastings was a talented rugby player and was a second-rower in the Australian schoolboys team before he gave the game away to focus on cricket. Away from the game, he is qualified as a physical education teacher."

            "- Kuldeep Yadav is the most successful left-arm wristspinner in the IPL. ",
            "- He was first introduced by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2016 in a continuation of their faith in left-arm wristspin, first starting alongside Brad Hogg and then replacing the veteran Australian.",
            "- His form fell away in the 2019 and 2020 seasons, and he missed IPL 2021 due to a knee injury before being let go by KKR.",
            "- In 2022, after six seasons with KKR, he was picked by Delhi Capitals (DC). The move seemed to work for him, 2022 being his most prolific IPL season: he took 21 wickets at a strike rate of 14.19, finishing in the tournament's top-five wicket-takers.",
            "Kuldeep Yadav started as a fast bowler when he first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, but was asked by his coach Kapil Pandey to switch to something much rarer - left-arm wristspin. The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations.",
            "There haven't been too many bowlers of his ilk in India, and Kuldeep, therefore, attracted immediate attention after successful stints at the Under-19 level.",
            "Kuldeep played his first India U-19 game in April 2012 as a 17-year old and and despite consistently taking wickets, he stayed below the radar.  It was the 2014 edition of the U-19 World Cup in Dubai that pushed his stocks higher. After a wicketless spell in the opening game against Pakistan, Kuldeep picked up a hat-trick in the next game against Scotland. \"As Kuldeep, mere ko wicket nikaalna hai (As Kuldeep, I knew I had to take wickets),\" he said after the match.",
            "He gained in stature in the games that followed, repeatedly troubling batsmen with his turn and finished with 14 wickets, the joint second-highest in the tournament. The performance seemed to justify why Kolkata Knight Riders' scouts had forked out $66,000 for him in the IPL auction prior to the Under-19 World Cup.",
            "Kuldeep had been part of the Mumbai Indians set-up in the 2012 season where he had a fond memory of bamboozling Sachin Tendulkar once in the nets with his wrong'un. That did not translate into an IPL debut. Nor did it happen with Knight Riders in the 2014 season. He had to wait until the Champions League where, playing as a support bowler to Sunil Narine, he impressed with his economy. Following those performances, he was included in India's ODI squad for the series against West Indies in October 2014, and he made his first-class and List A debuts shortly after."

            "Once tagged as one of Ireland's most promising batting hopefuls of the last decade from junior level, Tyrone Kane's future in the Ireland men's side has become more dependent on his ability to threaten with the ball as a medium-pace allrounder. Kane was Ireland's leading run scorer at the 2012 U-19 World Cup in Australia and, after his exploits in the tournament, he was named captain of Ireland's U-19 side in 2013 during their failed bid to reach the 2014 edition of the world event held in the UAE. ",
            "Hailing from Merrion CC, a club in Dublin which has produced several Ireland internationals, Kane received his first senior call-up just ahead of the 2015 World T20 Qualifier during a pre-tournament series against Scotland. Early into his international career, he was being groomed as a potential option to replace the aging John Mooney as a trusted seamer who could add a few lusty blows late with the bat. Kane, however, only played two games in the Qualifier and was dropped after Ireland's shock defeat in Belfast to Papua New Guinea despite taking career-best figures of 3 for 19. "

At the time of his national selection he had played only one first-class game.",

Close to half of his 41 Test wickets came in the four games he played after his return to the side in 2014, after seven years away. Towards the tail end of that period in the international wilderness, he lost confidence in his action, but he found his pace and ambition afresh following a move to Yorkshire from Durham",
            "Plunkett at his best had speed to spare, and the ability to send down the occasional unplayable ball. Subtlety and control were not his strong suits, though, and England designated him a white-ball player soon after his second coming.",
            "He made his first-class debut for Durham in 2003, and in 2005 took 50 wickets in a season for the first time. His Test debut came against Pakistan in Lahore that year, and he announced himself as a capable allrounder who could strike the ball a fair way from lower down the order, making a composed half-century in his second ODI, against the same opposition. ",

It was a performance that secured his ODI World Cup passage, though he only played three games in that tournament and lacked the incisiveness he had shown in Australia. His only ODI five-for came late in his career, against West Indies in Bristol, during a 4-0 series whitewash in 2017.",
            "In 2007, Plunkett played a role in Durham's first domestic trophy win: he took three wickets in the Friends Provident final his side won. He then spent a winter as Dolphins' overseas player in South Africa in 2007-08, and he shared in Durham's Championship success the following summer. They retained that title in 2009 and Plunkett starred with 49 wickets in the season, including nine in the innings win over Nottinghamshire that sealed the title.",
            "A combination of injuries and problems with his action then saw him slip down the pecking order at Durham, and after two lean seasons he moved to Yorkshire, where he showed signs of a resurgence, taking 35 wickets in 14 Championship matches in 2010. Two 40-plus-wicket seasons came back to back, in 2013 and 2014. Yorkshire won the title in the latter of those years, and in 2015, when Plunkett played a smaller role, taking 14 wickets from his five games.\n"

His prolific run with the bat continued after he moved to Chennai Super Kings in 2018, where he racked up 602 runs in his debut season for the franchise.",

He was part of the 2015 World Cup squad but did not get a game. The following year he was left out of India's World T20 side. ",
            "After a two-year lull, he found himself back in the ODI side in 2018, appearing in 11 of the 20 matches India played that year, and scoring his third ODI century, against West Indies. He was left out of the World Cup squad in 2019, though, and announced his retirement from all cricket following the snub - but quickly rescinded that decision and came back to captain Hyderabad in domestic cricket and turn out for Chennai Super Kings for another four seasons in the IPL, two of them title-winning.\n"

            "- He had another lean season with RR in 2023, scoring 261 runs from 11 innings, and was traded to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) ahead of IPL 2024.",
            "Padikkal first came to attention in 2020 as a 20-year-old after a breakout domestic season where he was the top run-getter in both white-ball tournaments, and then winning the emerging-player award in his debut IPL season, racking up 473 runs. At 6ft 3in, left-hander Padikkal, primarily an opener, is able to use his height and reach to meet good-length balls on the rise. He took his first-season form into the 2020-21 Vijay Hazare Trophy, in which he became the first Indian batter to score four consecutive List A hundreds. He made over 400 runs in the 2021 IPL as well, and it led to an India call-up, in Sri Lanka. But just when Padikkal's career was taking off, an acute intestinal issue struck him, affecting his form and fitness for two years. After two middling seasons with Rajasthan Royals, where he shuttled up and down the order, he was traded to Lucknow Super Giants ahead of the 2024 IPL. He found his feet again just before that, becoming Karnataka's top run-getter in the 2023-24 Vijay Hazare Trophy and following it up with four hundreds in six first-class games."

He was part of the Under-19 squad for the World Cup in Bangladesh in 2003-04 before making it to the Northern Districts squad. He was the second-highest run-scorer for his state team in his third season (2006-07) with 564 runs at 37.60. He was in prime form during the one-day State Shield competition in 2008-09 with 509 runs at a stunning 63.62 and that helped him earn a place in the New Zealand one-day squad for the ODIs in the UAE against Pakistan.",

Between 2009 and 2012, he played only eight Tests - the first six as a specialist batsman - before settling into the role of New Zealand's full-time wicketkeeper for the longer format in 2013. "

There were yet more charges to be added to his sheet, as Benn was dismissed from the field by his own captain during South Africa's one-day whitewashing of West Indies in 2010  after apparently refusing to bowl over the wicket, and in the Test series which followed was involved in several colourful exchanges with Dale Steyn.

            "James Foster was earmarked early on as an England wicketkeeper in the making, and though opportunities at the top were intermittent, he has earned a reputation as one of the best glovemen in the English game. In the latter part of his career, Foster also combined keeping and captaincy with being one of the mainstays of the Essex batting. A reward for his longevity came late: he was 37 when he won a championship-winning medal as part of Essex's 2017 side. Earlier in the season, he had been omitted, but responded with spirit, regained his place and was duly rewarded. A year later, he was told that it was time to move on and retired with some reluctance. He joked that his first job was to act as Alastair Cook's bodyguard as he travelled on the tube to his farewell Test at The Oval.",
            "Foster's career began in meteoric fashion. After just four first-class matches for Essex he was selected for the England A tour of West Indies in 2000-01. At this point he was still sharing the English season between his studies at Durham University and playing for Essex, but once he committed full-time to cricket he was being talked of as a successor to Alec Stewart. His chance came on the 2001-02 one-day tour of Zimbabwe, where he made his debut at Harare, before earning a spot on the trip to India after Stewart opted out. He made a nervous start at Mohali, but became more assured during the tour and impressed with some determined innings.",
            "He retained his place for the tour of New Zealand after Christmas, but was ousted from the one-day squad when England searched for greater balance by using Marcus Trescothick. Then came a cruel break - literally - when his arm was broken during nets with Essex, allowing Stewart to slot back into the team. Though Foster performed consistently in county cricket there was no way back in the summer of 2002, but he'd done enough to be the reserve keeper on the Ashes tour that winter. He won one more Test cap, at Melbourne, when Stewart injured his arm, but was fighting a losing battle as England attempted to field five bowlers. When Stewart retired at the end of the 2003 season, Andrew Flintoff's emergence had opened the way for a keeper at No. 7 - but it was Chris Read, not Foster, who got the nod. Thereafter, Geraint Jones and latterly Matt Prior claimed the gloves. ",
            "Foster was promoted to Essex vice-captain during the 2007 season and impressed with both his batting and keeping in 2008 - in particular his standing up to the stumps, which was one of the decisive factors of his call-up to England's World Twenty20 squad in 2009. Foster caught the eye for his work behind the stumps during the tournament, notably with a brilliant stumping of Yuvraj Singh against India, but was nevertheless left out of England's training and Lions squads ahead of that summer's Ashes series.",
            "He slotted straight back into Essex's side and in September sent a message to the England selectors about his hitting power when he struck Durham legspinner Scott Borthwick for five consecutive sixes off the first five balls of an over at Chester-le-Street. He was overlooked once again for the World Twenty20 in 2010 but refused to dwell on the snub and in June was named Essex Twenty20 captain. A month later he took over full duties from Mark Pettini. ",
            "Despite Essex failing to live up to their potential in the Championship, the limited-overs side under Foster were consistently impressive - although again without the trophies to prove it. Foster has developed into a skilful and innovative finisher, his idiosyncratic foot movement often disturbing bowlers, and he impressed for Northern Districts as a Twenty20 player in 2012-13. ",
            "There were whispers once again of an England recall with the return of Peter Moores as England coach in 2014 and uncertainty over the fitness of Prior but the Test gauntlets were soon passed on to Jos Buttler. By the end of the following season, he accepted a role as cricket professional of Forest School in East London and, although he stressed Essex would remain his priority, it signalled that his career was nearing a close. He began by conceding the captaincy to Ryan ten Doeschate, but his zest during the promotion year that followed was enough to win a final two years in the game to which he had given so much."

            "Confident, aggressive and blessed with great ball-striking talent, Ryan Campbell was an explosive batsman and wicketkeeper. Although consistency eluded him at times, there were few players at Australian interstate level as destructive with the bat. Campbell was introduced to the Western Australian team as a wicketkeeping replacement for Adam Gilchrist, but quickly carved a niche for himself as a specialist batsman. With breezy shot-making, he seemed naturally suited to a role as a one-day opener, and he also filled that position in the four-day game, especially after he had registered both the fastest half-century and century in the course of an Australian first-class season in 1996-97. ",
            "Increasing international appearances for Gilchrist resulted in Campbell's return (on an intermittent basis, at least) to the keeping role, but it was his ability to set the side on flying starts for which he was best known. Among many belligerent innings for the Warriors, arguably the most noteworthy was a whirlwind 108 off only 85 balls that laid the foundation for his team's dramatic victory over Queensland in the 1999-2000 Mercantile Mutual Cup final. In the same season he posted his top score of 203 against Queensland before he endured a difficult 2000-01 following knee surgery, and reportedly considered an offer to move to Victoria. ",
            "He elected to stay in Perth and was rewarded with two one-day appearances for Australia in 2001-02 and 2002-03 as well as selection for Australia A. In the following seasons the development of Luke Ronchi kept him on his toes and he eventually made way for him on a full-time basis in January 2006. Campbell finished his career in ninth place on the Pura Cup-Sheffield Shield list of Western Australian run-scorers with 5421, and was fourth on the wicketkeeping dismissals table with 242. He later joined the Indian Cricket League before its third season in 2008-09. ",
            "At Nagpur in March 2016, and at the age of 44, Campbell made a remarkable return to international cricket, debuting for Hong Kong against Zimbabwe in the opening match of the World Twenty20. With a Chinese grandmother, and having settled in Hong Kong with his family, his T20I debut came 14 years after his last ODI appearance."

            "A pocket-sized attacking wicket-keeper-batsman, Parthiv Patel entered the international scene in 2002 when, at 17 years and 153 days, he became Test cricket's youngest wicketkeeper after making his debut at Trent Bridge. Initially, Parthiv's glovework varied from competent to shoddy, but it was his ability with the bat that got him an extended run with the national side. But, his increasingly sloppy work behind the stumps saw him lose his place in 2004, and with the emergence of Dinesh Karthik and then MS Dhoni, Parthiv went further down in the pecking order.",
            "Parthiv made sporadic comebacks but with Dhoni firmly entrenched in the limited-overs sides, he had to compete for the second keeper's slot with Wriddhiman Saha - who became the first-choice wicket-keeper in Tests following Dhoni's retirement - Naman Ojha and Karthik. Parthiv tweaked his training methods - he split his day into two exclusive sessions of batting and keeping - to ensure optimum fitness and performance levels, and it began to pay off. ",
            "In IPL 2015, Parthiv, after a lukewarm beginning, struck form in the latter half of the tournament and tallied 339 runs to finish as the fourth-leading batsman in Mumbai Indians' victorious campaign. Later in the year, Parthiv brought up his first List-A hundred to lead Gujarat to their maiden Vijay Hazare Trophy title. The runs began to flow as he racked up four fifties from nine innings in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament and a century against India A in the Deodhar Trophy. "

Kabir took him under his wing, and taught him how to bowl, and how to be a cricketer. Within a year, he was playing first-class cricket for Rajshahi, and by mid-2018, he would appear for Bangladesh A in two series."

            "Much like his father Roger, Stuart Binny is a hard-hitting batsman in the lower middle order and a bowler of medium-paced swing and seam with a distinctive leap into a side-on delivery stride. He struggled initially to find a regular place in the Karnataka line-up, and signed up for the Indian Cricket League in 2007. He made a name for himself as one of the tournament's premier allrounders, playing for Hyderabad Heroes and India XI.",
            "After two seasons in the unsanctioned tournament, Binny accepted the BCCI's amnesty offer and quit the ICL. He returned to the Karnataka squad and established himself as an important member of the side, often scoring runs in crisis situations and chipping in regularly as a partnership-breaker. He was picked in the India A squad for the tour of South Africa in 2013 and was rewarded with a national call-up later that year with the ODI squad to New Zealand. He had a solid domestic season in 2013-14, scoring 443 runs at 43.22 and taking 14 wickets at 32.64, playing a key role in Karnataka's storming run to the Ranji Trophy title. Selected for an ODI tour of Bangladesh, he surprised everyone - possibly including himself - with his figures of 6 for 4, the best by an Indian bowler in ODIs, in the second ODI in Mirpur.",
            "Binny was a surprise inclusion in the squad for the five-Test series in England in 2014, and with India looking for an extra bowling option, he made his debut in the first Test at Trent Bridge. There was little help for him on an uncharacteristically dry and slow track, and he finished wicketless in the 10 overs he bowled, but he played a crucial role with the bat in India's second innings, calming their nerves after a mini-collapse on the final day and helping save the Test with an innings of 78. Binny was dismissed cheaply in both innings of the second Test at Lord's, and was left out for the third and fourth Tests. He returned at The Oval, went wicketless again, and was the not-out batsman on 25 when India slumped to 94 all out in their final innings of the series.",
            "Binny remained a regular in India's ODI squads, though his playing opportunities were limited. He went to the 2015 World Cup, but didn't get to play a match. He was called up midway through the Test tour of Sri Lanka later that year, and performed creditably with the ball to play a small but important role in India's 2-1 series win. India picked him for the second Test of the home series against South Africa later in the year at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, his home ground, but rain washed out the last four days, restricting his contribution to a mere three overs."

He then played as a No. 3 batsman for Dhaka's first-division side Cricket Coaching School (CCS). He has continued to play for CCS, despite bigger offers, and was instrumental in the team's promotion to the Premier Cricket League in Dhaka.",

He also hit a bizarre 91 off 30 balls against England for Bangladesh A in a tour match in March 2010, though at the time England's bowlers were hoping for a declaration in a match that ended up as a draw.",

If his birth records are correct, Sunny made his first-class debut for Dhaka Division at the age of 15 years, 4 months and 9 days. He has continued to bowl more and more over the years, always getting a decent deal in the Dhaka Premier League and mostly ending the season among the top ten wicket-takers. In first-class cricket he had one missed season, 2010-11, but took 50 wickets in the next season to make sure nobody forgot about him."

He did even better at the T20 World Cup later that year, where he was India's top wicket-taker. In his first game, in front of 90,000 spectators at the MCG, Arshdeep produced a spell for the ages, removing Babar Azam with an inswinger with his first ball and sending back Mohammad Rizwan with a searing bouncer to leave Pakistan at 15 for 2.",

            "A legspinning allrounder, Rehan had long been tipped for greatness. Shortly before his 12th birthday, he was used as a net bowler at Lord's before England's Test against Pakistan; when he returned the following summer in the same role, Shane Warne wandered over to watch him and confidently predicted that he would play first-class cricket at the age of 15.",
            "Warne was a couple of years early, but by the time that first-class debut arrived in May 2022, he had already impressed enough in England's run to the Under-19 World Cup final to convince Southern Brave to spend £50,000 on him in the Hundred draft, before he had made his professional debut. ",
            "Rehan won an England Lions call-up to face South Africa in mid-summer - having impressed in the Blast for Leicestershire, the county he joined from Nottinghamshire in late 2017. He made his maiden first-class hundred and took his first five-for in his third and final Championship game of the season, and England soon added him to their squad for their series in Pakistan.",
            "It was a fitting place for him to debut. His father Naeem grew up in Pakistan before moving to the UK to work as a taxi driver, and was present in the huddle as Nasser Hussain presented Rehan with his cap. He has two brothers: Raheem, a left-arm seamer, who he insists is the best player in the family; and Farhan, an offspinner."

            "A middle-order batsman with unique technique, Peter Handscomb earned his first Test call-up in 2016-17 after a prolific period for Victoria. His inclusion for the Adelaide Test against South Africa followed a career-best 215 in the Sheffield Shield, and the previous summer he had been the competition's third-leading run scorer. Handscomb immediately showed his comfort at Test level by striking 54 on debut against South Africa in Adelaide, also hitting the winning runs, and a maiden century came in his next Test against Pakistan at the Gabba. By the end of his first home summer of Test cricket, Handscomb was in the remarkable position of having not been dismissed below 50 in any of his first seven innings of Test cricket - the first player in Test history to have achieved that feat. ",
            "He debuted in ODI cricket in the same summer and then went on the tours of India and Bangladesh, playing vital match-saving and match-winning hands in Ranchi and Chittagong. But questions about his technique against pace bowling were raised during the 2017-18 Ashes and he lost his place after two Tests. He was recalled in Johannesburg on the infamous tour of South Africa following the Cape Town ball-tampering scandal, and looked set to become a permanent fixture following the suspensions of Steve Smith and David Warner, but a poor Australia A tour of India saw him miss selection for the UAE Test tour against Pakistan in October 2018.",
            "He was then recalled, dropped, recalled and dropped again during the home Test series against India and Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, he established himself in the ODI team as an adaptable middle order player. He made his T20I debut as a wicketkeeper on the limited-overs tour of India and scored  a maiden ODI century to help Australia to a record chase of 359 in Mohali. He was left out of the 2019 World Cup squad despite playing the previous 13 ODIs, because of Smith's return. He was thrown into the side for the semi-final against England as an injury replacement, but made only 4 as Australia fell to a heavy defeat."

            "Geraint Jones, as he happily admitted upon his retirement, will be remembered above all for one catch. With an unforgettable 2005 Ashes series surrendering to unbearable tension on a Sunday morning at Edgbaston, his nerve held firm as he swooped to scoop a catch behind the wicket offered by Michael Kasprowicz, to seal the two-run victory that changed Ashes history. He recalled \"seeing it in slow motion,\" rolling over and seeing umpire Billy Bowden's finger going up before joining England's celebrations.",
            "No player better encapsulated the fluctuating fortunes of that memorable series than Jones. Fast-tracked into the Test team at the expense of a superior gloveman, Chris Read, his selection was widely debated throughout the summer. England's coach Duncan Fletcher was a staunch advocate, Jones contributed energy to the cause and vital runs at key moments - none more important than his 85 in a stand of 177 with Andrew Flintoff at Trent Bridge - but he also produced enough fumbles for an edge to become a heart-in-the-mouth moment. He clung on to his place, however, and he also clung on to the chance that really mattered, emerging from the series more or less in credit - if not with his place secure.",
            "Keeping wicket for Kent brings with it a certain weight of history. Ames, Evans, Knott, Downton, Marsh is a formidable backstory, but Jones has earned his place in the dynasty. By the time he moved to Gloucestershire for a last hurrah in the county game, he had established himself as an elder statesman of the Kent squad, and in James Tredwell's absences with England in 2013 he was a natural selection as stand-in captain.  In 15 seasons with the club he made 14 hundreds and took more than 450 dismissals in 150 first-class appearances, in addition to his 34 Test caps.",
            "Born in Papua New Guinea to Welsh parents, Jones lived and learned his cricket in Australia until he was 22. He was almost 27 when he first came to the attention of the England selectors, but he had timed his run to perfection.",
            "In the 2003 season - Alec Stewart's last - Jones scored the best part of 1000 runs at an average of more than 50. After a brief stint at Glamorgan, he had moved to Kent, whose supporters are connoisseurs of fine keeping, but his weight of runs in the 2nd XI became a major factor in Paul Nixon's controversial return to Leicestershire.",
            "Jones was rewarded with a call-up to England's Test squad to tour West Indies, and after displacing Read behind the stumps in the fourth and final Test in Antigua, he cemented his place with a thrilling century against New Zealand at Headingley, where his sixth-wicket alliance with Flintoff had England fans rubbing their hands with glee. His counterpunching style remained seemingly well designed for a momentum-seizing half-century, but he had many critics and he managed just two fifties in ten Tests before being dropped in favour of Read in August 2006.",
            "He regained the No. 1 slot for the 2006-07 Ashes - a controversial choice - and, after three unproductive Tests, Fletcher was forced to hand the gloves back to Read. The emergence of Matt Prior in 2007 and the replacement of Fletcher, with Peter Moores (another coach with wicketkeeping experience) taking over, he slipped down the pecking order.",
            "Jones, who is a fully trained pharmacy technician, never seriously threatened to regain his England place but the winter of 2006-7 was not quite the end of his international adventures: five years later, he played for Papua New Guinea in the ICC World Twenty20 qualifiers, which took place in Dubai."

Sri Lanka's selectors, impressed by his performances as under-19 captain, fast-tracked him into the national squad for the Zimbabwe tour in April-May 2004 as they looked towards the future. Faced with a weak opposition, Maharoof picked up a bunch of wickets, but then came up against better competitors during the Asia Cup. He performed reasonably well, and made a mark with his swinging deliveries when South Africa came visiting. He had worked his way up through the representative ranks, playing for the Sri Lanka Under-15s, Under-17s and under-19s, and led the Under-19 team on four tours, including the 2004 Youth World Cup in Bangladesh.

            "A mean display during the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England, when he exploited the end-of-summer conditions expertly, indicated he could be especially useful when Sri Lanka play in seamer-friendly conditions. A useful series with bat and ball against Pakistan in early 2006 suggested he was ready to push on, but his bowling failed to impress on the tour of England - taking only one wicket in three Tests - in conditions that should have suited him.",
            "Then came an astonishing display at the Champions Trophy in India when his 6 for 14 skittled West Indies out for 80. He performed creditably with bat and ball for the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL's first season"

            "Chaminda Vaas is easily the most penetrative and successful new-ball bowler Sri Lanka have had, and he has served his country well. He swings and seams the ball with skill, his trademark delivery being the late indipper. However, he also bowls a carefully disguised offcutter, and has recently added reverse-swing to his armoury, a skill that has made him a consistent wicket-taker even on bland subcontinental pitches. He outbowled New Zealand's seamers in green conditions at Napier to give Sri Lanka their first win in an overseas Test, in 1994-95. In 2001-02 he made a quantum leap, taking 26 wickets in the 3-0 rout of West Indies, becoming only the second fast bowler, after Imran Khan, to take 14 wickets in a match in the subcontinent. He then went on to take the first-ever ODI eight-for, against Zimbabwe, which included a hat-trick. He also claimed a hat-trick with the first three balls of the match against Bangladesh in the 2003 World Cup. Vaas reached the 300-wicket milestone in Tests against India in 2005-06, having passed the mark in ODIs on the tour to Zimbabwe. In 2004 he also gained overdue recognition for his talent when he was selected for the World XI at the inaugural ICC Awards. Vaas is easily Sri Lanka's second-most successful bowler - after Muttiah Muralitharan - in both forms of the game. His approach to his batting is equally sincere and in recent years he has gradually gained recognition as a useful allrounder. He waited 97 Tests for his maiden century, against Bangladesh, and soon after, became the third Sri Lankan to play 100 Tests or more.",
            "In August 2008, Vaas crossed yet another milestone when he had Yuvraj Singh caught for a duck in Colombo to get his 400th ODI wicket and become the fourth bowler to reach the landmark.  ",
            "In July 2009, Vaas announced his retirement from Tests but said he will continue to play one-dayers and Twenty20s till the 2011 World Cup. \n"

            "For a long time, it seemed Steve O'Keefe was to be one of the most unfortunate men in Australian cricket in the post-Shane Warne era. As a parade of 13 spinners were tried in the Test team, often with less-than-compelling first-class records, O'Keefe was left to toil away for New South Wales with far superior figures. His opportunity finally came when he was named in Australia's Test squad to play Pakistan in the UAE in 2014, following a summer in which he topped the Sheffield Shield wicket tally with 41 victims at 20.43. A left-arm orthodox bowler and solid lower-order batsman, O'Keefe could no longer be ignored; he had also been the leading Shield spinner in a pace-dominated 2012-13, with 24 wickets at 22.20. But he played only one Test on that UAE tour, then a washed out Test at the SCG against West Indies, then a single Test in Sri Lanka in 2016 before injury ended his tour, then a single Test at the SCG against Pakistan. Four series, four Tests, and no momentum. Finally, everything came together for O'Keefe when he played alongside Nathan Lyon in the first Test against India in Pune in February 2017, and used his accuracy and natural variation to plunder 12 for 70, the best figures ever by a visiting spinner in a Test in India.",
            "He looked set to be Australia's number two spinner for future tours but an off-field alcohol indiscretion in 2017 seemingly ended such hopes yet he was surprisingly and controversially recalled for Australia's 2017 subsequent tour of Bangladesh despite being suspended by New South Wales at the time. Victorian rival Jon Holland was selected for Australia's next two overseas tours of South Africa and the UAE in 2018. "

He made his first-class debut in November 2005 and took 60 wickets at 18.26 in his first 15 matches. He topped the first-class and List A bowling rankings for the Warriors almost every season since then. His performance in the limited-overs form of the game has also been exceptional.

            "James Tredwell's unassuming manner gives him the air of a Rotary Club chairman rather than an international sportsman, but for all his mild-mannered ways he quietly built a decent cricketing career with both Kent and England. When he retired in 2018, having not played a game in his final summer, he had taken 830 wickets for Kent in 613 matches since making his debut in 2000 and also made a decent contribution to England in difficult times.",
            "He had racked up almost a decade of unswerving county service by the time England gave him the first of his 45 ODI caps, against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2010, and his offspin - bowled in a more old-fashioned, slower style than was the norm among many of his international contemporaries - has given England stout service. Such is Tredwell's unfashionable air that he was content to talk ahead of an England tour of his hobby making home-made jam and chutney, and imagined packing a couple of jars to help him through his latest overseas assignment.  In Kent in particular, they valued his gentle talents, backed up by excellent close catching and some useful lower-order batting.  As Vic Marks wrote in The Guardian: \"James Tredwell is not and never will be a superstar. He is the journeyman's journeyman and a fine antidote to the celebrity cricketer.\"",
            "It was as a limited-overs cricketer that Tredwell also made most of his early appearances for Kent but by 2003 he was representing the county in both forms of the game on a regular basis. He captained the England Under-19s side and led Kent second XI to success in the Second XI Trophy final of 2002 when he scored 111. His obvious potential elevated him to a place in the ECB National Academy squad for 2003-04, where he found himself captaining the squad in difficult circumstances following the withdrawal of Alex Gidman. His performances earned him a call up to the England Performance Squad in the winter of 2007. He was subsequently rewarded with inclusion in England's one-day squad for their tour of New Zealand in 2008.",
            "Tredwell didn't get a game on that tour, but steady performances with the England Lions and Kent, including a career-best 123 not out against a touring New Zealand side and 69 wickets in the County Championship in 2009 kept him in contention. He was called up as cover for Swann during England's tour to South Africa in 2009-10 and, although once again he did not feature in a starting XI, he was included in the Lions tour to UAE in February 2010. His consistent performances booked him a place in England's squad to tour Bangladesh in February and March 2010 and he finally made his debut in the second Test at Dhaka, taking six wickets in England's nine-wicket win.  He was one of four spinners chosen for England's tour of Sri Lanka in March 2012 and he played a part in the one-day series against Australia and South Africa that summer.",
            "With Swann rested, he made his T20 international debut in India in December 2012 and then followed that up with 11 wickets in the ODIs that followed after Christmas. He was a very different character to the extrovert - and highly successful - Swann and, if he was unlikely ever to hit such heights, he made international cricket seem a polite place to be. His progress as an offspinner was steady rather than spectacular but he had a steady temperament and ability to vary his pace good habits can bring rewards and they started to come thick and fast. England's interest did not extend to Test cricket: he won his first of two caps against Bangladesh in Dhaka and, following Swann's sudden retirement during a Test whitewash in Australia in 2013-14, England looked elsewhere the following summer before giving him a second cap in Antigua in 2015.",
            "Tredwell's was named Kent captain for 2013, following Rob Key's decision to stand down. But his form in first-class cricket had by then become less impressive than in the shorter formats and, under challenge from the tyro Adam Riley, he even accepted a loan spell at Sussex in 2014 in search of regular cricket before returning to Kent at the end of the season and settling back in with typical economy in the limited-overs formats.",
            "England's disastrous World Cup campaign in Australia in 2015, though, ended his England career at 33. Peter Moores was sacked as coach, Trevor Bayliss took over and a new high-energy brand of cricket had no place for him. \"Sometimes a change of view means that some people are put on the rubbish tip,\" he said. When he fell out of favour with Kent in 2017, he sought discussions with other counties to try to attain regular cricket, but his career was nearing its end."

Birt topped the state's one-day averages the previous season with 385 runs at 48.12 but his lack of runs at first-class level resulted in him slipping out of the Sheffield Shield side.

            "Rahul Dravid was probably one of the last classical Test match batters, and one of the greatest. ",
            "His progress into the India side may have been steady and methodical rather than meteoric, but once there, he established himself at the vanguard of a new, defiant Indian side who were no longer easybeats away from home. Armed with an orthodox technique, he became the cement that held the foundations firm while the flair players expressed themselves. Yet, for a man who came to be stereotyped as one-paced and one-dimensional, he could stroke the ball around when the mood struck him.",
            "Dravid compensated for his relative lack of athleticism with sheer hard work and powers of concentration that were almost yogic. In Adelaide in 2003, when India won a Test in Australia for the first time in a generation, he batted 835 minutes over two innings. A few months later he was at the crease more than 12 hours for the 270 that clinched India's first series win in Pakistan. That formidable concentration also came in handy when he was standing in the slips, where he took 210 catches in Tests, the record. ",
            "After impressing in a Lord's debut in 1996, where he was eclipsed by Sourav Ganguly, Dravid's breakthrough innings arrived at the Wanderers a few months later, against a South Africa attack accustomed to bullying visitors. A brief slump followed, but he emerged from that in 2001 with perhaps one of the most famous supporting performances of all, in a partnership of 376 with VVS Laxman that resulted in an unlikely victory after India followed on against Steve Waugh's Australia. The half-decade that followed was a golden one with the bat: tours of England and Australia, in 2002 and 2003-04, fetched Dravid more than 600 runs apiece.",
            "A two-year stint as captain, following Ganguly's axing, was less successful, though he did lead the side to series victories in West Indies in 2006 and in England the year after, the first time in a generation India had won in those places. Just when it seemed his best was behind him, Dravid showed his class once again on the tour to England in 2011: in a series in which India were completely outplayed and none of their other batters scored more than 275 runs in the Tests, he amassed 461, including three hundreds, two of them when opening the innings against a high-quality pace attack. However, that was followed by a poor series in Australia, which turned out to be his last.",
            "Initially seen as a liability in the one-day arena, Dravid retooled his white-ball game over the years to become an adept middle-order finisher, and by the time the selectors eased him aside in early 2008, he had more than 10,000 ODI runs to his name. For a good while, he kept wicket in the 50-overs side, helping the team to find a balance that was crucial in India's run to the World Cup final in 2003.\n"

            "Few players have burned as brightly at the start of their international careers as Gary Ballance. From his debut in Sydney amid the wreckage of the 2013-14 Ashes, through to the West Indies tour the following winter, Ballance was a pillar of strength at No. 3 in the order. It took him just ten Tests, and 17 innings, to reach 1000 Test runs - behind only Herbert Sutcliffe and Len Hutton as the fastest for England. At that point, he averaged 67.93, with four hundreds and five fifties.",
            "But the flame quickly guttered. Ballance's next 13 Tests yielded just two half-centuries and by the time he was dropped for the third time in mid-2017, his Test average sat at 37.45. Even when he rediscovered some of his most-prolific form with Yorkshire in 2019, scoring 975 Championship runs, including five hundreds, talk of an international recall was muted. In between, Ballance took time away from the game to deal with anxiety issues, relinquishing the Yorkshire captaincy along the way.",
            "Born in Zimbabwe but having moved to England as a schoolboy, Ballance's reputation began to blossom during a run-rich 2013 season for Yorkshire after which he was selected for England's tour of Australia. He made his Test debut at the end of England's 5-0 whitewash and followed up an ODI debut in Dublin the previous summer with further limited-overs forays against Australia.",
            "At the start of the home summer, with England searching for a successor to Jonathan Trott, Ballance stepped into the breach. In no time, his nuggety left-handed batting style was providing the backbone of the Test line-up. There was nothing overly stylish about his approach, but his discipline and shrewdness was apparent and he could step up the tempo when necessary. Ballance, in the coach's parlance, was a batman who \"found a way\".",
            "A maiden Test hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's was followed by two in successive Tests against India, at Lord's again and Southampton. Only Trott and Andrew Strauss had previously made hundreds in their first two Tests at Lord's. There was some low-key drunken notoriety as well as he stripped topless in a Nottingham night club to celebrate victory over India at Trent Bridge. ",
            "That sense of chubby, red-faced permanence ran aground in 2015 as he first lost his ODI place following a forgettable World Cup, and then New Zealand and Australia in turn exposed a shuffling back-foot technique. Amid heavy criticism, he was dropped for the third Ashes Test with his Yorkshire team-mate Jonny Bairstow preferred. Few batsmen played so strikingly deep in the crease, but he insisted that he would remain true to the method that had brought him such success. Such faith did not bring immediate rewards, though: a return against Pakistan the following summer brought one score above 50, before he was dropped in Bangladesh and consigned to inactivity on the subsequent five-Test tour of India.",
            "Such was the pessimism around his England chances that Yorkshire made him captain in the Championship and he responded with an early season avalanche of runs, becoming only the second Yorkshire batsman (Younis Khan was the other) to hit a double-century and century in the same match. With England's top-order failings evident, he gained a reprieve for two Tests against South Africa, and found himself in the Ashes squad for the 2017-18 tour - although again he did not get near the XI.",
            "Shortly after the start of the 2018 season, Ballance was given time off for personal reasons by Yorkshire. When he returned, it was without the responsibility of captaincy, although he continued to be a reliable pillager of runs at county level.",
            "Ballance had always seemed set to play internationally. Aged just 16, he appeared for Zimbabwe at the 2006 Under-19 World Cup, taking three wickets and top-scoring with the bat in a win over England, the country he had already settled on moving to in order to pursue a career. He took up a sports scholarship at Harrow the same year and his relationship to Dave Houghton (who is married to the cousin of Ballance's father), facilitated several appearances for Derbyshire as a schoolboy, including an innings of 73 in a Pro40 game while still aged 16.",
            "At the end of 2007, Ballance signed an academy contract with Yorkshire, allowing him to begin a university course at Leeds Metropolitan University - although he dropped out after a year. He made his Yorkshire debut in 2008, sharing digs for a time with his soon-to-be England colleague Joe Root, but only featured sporadically at first. He also returned to Zimbabwe during the offseason to play for Mid West Rhinos, where he gained his first experience of captaincy.",
            "He broke into the Yorkshire first team in 2011 and consistent performances led to selection for the England Lions squad for a limited-overs tour of Australia in February 2013, where Ballance made three half-centuries despite the team losing every game. Centuries for the Lions against Australia and Bangladesh A during the 2013 season pressed his case further and led to an ODI debut against Ireland. He made a two-ball duck but 1251 Championship runs, including five hundreds, were enough to win him a place in England's Ashes squad to tour Australia."

            "Ashish Nehra had most of the virtues of a classical left-arm fast bowler - pace, accuracy, subtle variations of line and length, an ability to move the ball off the wicket, and a devastating late inswinger that could harass the best. But with all those gifts came a curse: a brittle body that may well have contributed to him playing his last Test as early as 2004. Still, T20 cricket, with its cap of only four overs, gave Nehra a lifeline, and at 36 he revived his international career, having rediscovered the ability to move the ball at 140kph, to become one of India's most successful bowlers in the 2016 T20 World Cup.",
            "Nehra came out of his first full tour - to Zimbabwe in 2000-01 - with his reputation as one of the most promising new-ball bowlers on the international circuit vastly enhanced, and his performance in Bulawayo in that series played a key role in India winning a Test outside the subcontinent for the first time in 15 years. He struggled to establish himself thereafter, as inconsistency and injuries saw him slip down the pace-bowling list.",
            "The high point of that difficult period came in the 2003 World Cup against England, where he took 6 for 23. Surgery on a troublesome ankle, and an indifferent tour of Australia, followed. He pulled out midway through the 2005 Zimbabwe tour and had a succession of operations on his ankle that slowed down his career. He hit the headlines with creditable showings in the IPL, particularly in the second season, and was recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of the West Indies in June 2009.",
            "His 31 ODI wickets in 2009 were the most he had ever taken in a year, and he followed it up with 28 in 2010 to establish his place in India's 2011 World Cup squad. He bowled a match-winning spell against Pakistan in the semi-final of that tournament, but his body failed him again - an on-field injury prevented him from playing the final, which India won to become world champions.",
            "In the IPL, Nehra took 22 wickets for Chennai Super Kings in 2015, willing himself back into contention for India, whom he helped whitewash Australia 3-0 in a T20I series in 2015-16. He took that run of fine form into the Asia Cup and the 2016 T20 World Cup before calling it a day.",
            "Nehra moved into coaching in the IPL after that, as bowling coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore for two seasons, and in 2022 was Gujarat Titans head coach when they won the title in their first year in the tournament.\n"

Well over six feet tall, with flowing jet black hair and a piercing gaze, Shapoor's run-up begins most of the way to the boundary and he's built a name for himself with pace, bounce and aggression as a left-arm seamer. As an out-and-out fast bowler there is, of course, always a hostile element to his bowling and as Shapoor explains it: \"I am angry every time I bowl. A bowler has to be angry, so that his reaction can carry over to the batsmen, who get unsettled and end up making a mistake.\"",
            "Shapoor was born in the Logar Province, Afghanistan, but like many in his generation he escaped to Peshawar, Pakistan when war enveloped the region. There, he developed his game at the Arbab Niaz Stadium and Gymthana, and started playing hard-ball cricket in 2001. He initially hoped to play for Pakistan, naming Shoaib Akhtar as his fast-bowling idol, but when Iqbal Sikander, who played a handful of ODIs for Pakistan, started coaching in Afghanistan, Shapoor moved back there."

            "Michael Vaughan will forever be known in English sporting history as the first captain to win an Ashes series in a generation, his calm, obdurate and ruthlessly effective leadership overshadowing his not inconsiderable contributions as a batter armed with a classy, composed technique that placed him briefly at the top of the world rankings. ",
            "Vaughan faced up to his first ball in Test cricket with England four wickets down for two runs on a damp flyer in Johannesburg in November 1999 and drew immediate comparisons with Michael Atherton for his inhumanly calm aura at the crease. Unlike Atherton, Vaughan blossomed magnificently, playing with a freedom of expression that Atherton had never approached. ",
            "He sparkled his way to 900 runs in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India in 2002, the prelude to a formidable series in Australia in which he became the first visiting batter in over three decades to top 600 runs. Vaughan was appointed captain of England's one-day side in time for the 2003 home season, and inherited the Test captaincy two weeks later when Nasser Hussain abdicated out of the blue. Despite a torrid baptism against South Africa, including a massive defeat at Lord's, Vaughan guided his team to a 2-2 draw. After a stutter in Sri Lanka, he confirmed the arrival of a new era by leading England to a rout of West Indies on their home soil, the first time in over 35 years an England team had achieved such a feat. ",
            "He missed the opening Test of the summer that year but returned to guide England to a clean sweep with victories over New Zealand (3-0) and West Indies (4-0), went on to record a memorable 2-1 series win in South Africa, and then achieved nirvana with the same scoreline in arguably the greatest series of all time. ",
            "That was Vaughan's pinnacle. It was followed by time out of cricket with a knee injury that also kept him out of England's infamous 2006-07 series in Australia, where they were pummelled 5-0 under Andrew Flintoff. Vaughan was recalled, as one-day captain, for the CB Series, which England won, though he himself only played three of ten games. Two months after the 2007 ODI World Cup, which he limped through in more ways than one, he quit the white-ball captaincy, having had by then re-established himself at the helm of the Test side. ",
            "He scored a memorable century on home turf at Headingley in his comeback game, but though there were hundreds against India at Trent Bridge later that year, and New Zealand at Lord's in 2008, he was never quite the same. After a loss to South Africa at Edgbaston that year, he resigned. Though he vowed to play on, as the 2009 Ashes drew closer it became apparent that he was out of contention and he called it quits in June 2009.",
            "After retirement, he took to life as a commentator (on social media as much as on television) with gusto, often ruffling feathers with his views. In 2021, Vaughan was named in the report that followed Azeem Rafiq's allegations of systemic racism in the Yorkshire cricket set-up, in regard to alleged use of racist language ahead of a county game in 2009, but he was cleared after a hearing by the ECB."

As of 2022, his ODI bowling average was bettered only by Joel Garner, Rashid Khan and Sandeep Lamichhane among bowlers with at least 50 ODI wickets.",
            "After playing the last of his six Pakistan domestic matches, Bilal took up a job offer in Muscat and began the ICC's four-year qualification process before making his Oman debut late in 2015. The ICC's guidelines at the time said only two players could be in the starting XI who were four-year residents but not yet seven-year residents of an adopted country, and so Bilal struggled to crack the regular Oman starting line-up over the course of 2016, but a breakout performance at the Desert T20 tournament in the UAE in January 2017 turned things around. From then on, he was a catalyst for Oman's rise from Division Five of the World Cricket League all the way up to achieving ODI status in 2019. ",
            "Bilal's pace is a couple of notches under express but his sharp inswing can be a handful for Associate batters not used to such skill at those speeds with the new ball. Far more deadly are his spells bowling at the death, which feature a devastating reverse-swinging yorker. Hong Kong found out the hard way in an elimination match at the 2019 T20 World Cup Qualifier in Dubai in a spell that helped Oman clinch a return trip to the T20 World Cup. ",
            "Bilal played all 35 matches for Oman in the 2019-2023 ICC Cricket World Cup League Two ODI tournament for Associates and finished as far and away their leading bowler, with 76 wicket-taker including three five-wicket hauls. In a tournament format structured with ODIs often played on back-to-back days, it was a remarkable feat not just of dominance but durability. "

The following season, he was the second highest run-scorer for the Titans in the 20-over competition and third highest run-scorer in the first-class competition with 602 runs at 37.62.

            "Tim Murtagh is a bustling swing bowler with a marching run-up who, late in a career that has stretched into his forties, has enjoyed the chance to play international cricket with Ireland. His pace is lively without being express but his dependable accuracy makes him one of the most reliable new-ball bowlers on the county circuit, and, for their promotion push in 2022, Middlesex's club captain. He can also be a destructive lower-order hitter.",
            "Though now a stalwart at Lord's, Murtagh actually came through Surrey's age-group sides and was a member of the England Under-19 squad during the 1999 World Cup, subsequently touring Sri Lanka with a British Universities side in 2002. He battled his way into the Surrey side, and in 2005 took a competition-best 6 for 24 in a Twenty20 tie against Middlesex at Lord's. Nevertheless, he moved north of the river to Lord's in 2007 where he felt his opportunities would be greater. And they were. Consistent in all forms of cricket, and with a liking for the big occasion, he took 104 wickets in all three formats in 2008 and began to establish himself as a county stalwart. Surprisingly, he was overlooked for the England development squad, but had his chance to shine in Middlesex's trip to Antigua for the Stanford 20/20 for 20. Together with Steven Finn he led Middlesex's attack in 2011, taking 80 wickets at 20.98 as the county gained promotion from Division Two.",
            "In early 2012 Murtagh qualified for Ireland based on his grandparents. He had to wait a few months to become a regular, but, after the retirement of Trent Johnston and Boyd Rankin's defection to England, soon became the leader of Ireland's attack, and took 3 for 33 against England in front of 10,000 spectators at Malahide in September 2013. He withdrew from the 2015 World Cup because of a foot injury, and subsequently retired from T20Is ahead of the 2016 World T20. But after making his Test debut at the age of 37 in Ireland's maiden appearance in the format in 2018, he achieved arguably the crowning glory of his career, at his Middlesex home of Lord's the following season. In July 2019, his first-morning figures of 5 for 13 routed England for 85, and though Ireland went on to lose their maiden Test in England, his place on the away dressing-room honours board was secured."

            "A burly and bustling allrounder, Rory Kleinveldt came from the assembly line of South Africa's seam-bowling, lower middle-order hitting two-in-ones. Although his potential was never fully realised at international level, he excelled domestically at home and on the county circuit.",
            "Hailing from a cricketing family - Kleinveldt's uncle Johnny played under the South African Cricket Board pre-unity in 1991 - Kleinveldt was involved in the game from an early age. He was a member of South Africa's Under-19 team which made the final of the 2002 World Cup, and after a stint with the South African Academy side, he was fast-tracked into first-class cricket by Western Province in 2002-03. ",
            "After several impressive seasons with Cobras, He was rewarded with a spot in the South Africa A side touring India in 2007, and finally a call-up to the national one-day squad in October 2008. He did not get a game though, and went on to have a disastrous T20I debut - he scored 3 and bowled a wicketless 20-run over. He had to wait two years for another chance, which he got at the 2010 World T20, but another forgettable outing saw him left out of the team again. ",
            "Kleinveldt finally got a sustained run in 2012-13 season, when he made his Test debut in Australia. He was picked as part of an all-pace attack to bowl on what was expected to be a spicy Brisbane track, but went wicket-less on a flat surface. Better performances came in Adelaide and at home in Port Elizabeth against New Zealand, but in an attack with Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander, Kleinveldt struggled to nail down a regular place in Tests.  ",
            "In limited-overs cricket, Kleinveldt played 10 ODIs in the first seven months of 2013 but middling performances saw him lose his place. He continued to play as a senior stalwart for Cobras and initially looked to try and claim back his national place but fell behind in a queue of upcoming quicks.  ",
            "In 2015, his career took a different path when he signed for Northants. He was their leading bowler in the County Championship with 57 wickets from 13 matches and played a role in their T20 run to Finals Day. That summer, Kleinveldt confirmed he had no interest in resuming an international career and furnished CSA with a letter detailing that when he went to play at the Masters Champions League. ",
            "Although that tournament seemed to require that players retire from all forms of cricket, Kleinveldt continued to play for Cobras and signed for Northants in 2016 as well.  He was a natural addition to a county that revelled in its nickname of The Chubsters and his competitive edge made him an instant favourite, both with the ball and as an increasingly dangerous hitter. A career-best 9 for 65 on a green pitch at Northampton was one of the highlights and contributed to an unexpected Northants promotion challenge in 2017 which only died on the final day of the season. He retired a year later, at 35, after a combative period in which he took 140 wickets for Northants and produced several combustible innings.",

With a natural, whippy action that generated easy pace, he immediately stood out even in that most competitive of fields - Pakistani fast bowling. A year later, he was making his Pakistan debut in Brisbane, though not before adversity touched him; he would lose his mother just before he received his first Pakistan cap. ",
            "His talent was so blindingly obvious it was only a matter of when things clicked for him. He became the youngest fast bowler in Test history to take a five-wicket haul, doing so in Karachi against Sri Lanka in just his second match. Records continued to tumble, with Naseem becoming the youngest to take a Test match hat-trick in his third Test against Bangladesh. ",
            "Bodies that young don't often have to handle the force required to generate that sort of speed, and what followed was a spate of injuries that initially impacted his performance before sidelining him for more than a year. It wasn't until the third Test against Australia in Lahore in March 2022 that Naseem returned to the international fold. Mercifully, the pace was still extreme and there were no signs of the injuries he had nursed during his time away.",
            "If anything, Naseem has gone on to become a potent white-ball player. Until as recently as August 2022, he had never played a white-ball international, but in Shaheen Afridi's absence, has blossomed in that leading role. His first T20I career over, where he dismissed KL Rahul and toyed with Virat Kohli, was one Shaheen himself would have been proud of, and further performances in the Asia Cup only bolstered his reputation. It's easy to sometimes forget that the man currently spearheading Pakistan's vaunted fast bowling line-up is just 19, and with the T20 WOrld Cup looming, he has the chance to go back to where his international career began and show the world how far  he has come. And, of course, how much farther he can still go. "

            "As a left-hand opening batsman, Shahriar Nafees is a rarity among Bangladesh cricketers, and at the age of 19 he was thrust into the Test squad for their maiden tour of England with just five first-class matches behind him. He hadn't fared too badly in those, however, with 350 runs at 35, and his Under-19 coach Richard McInness reckoned he had the talent and temperament to become a future Test captain. With Nafees Iqbal and Javed Omar established as Bangladesh's opening pair, the England trip was a case of watching and learning for Shahriar. He did get an opportunity in the NatWest Series, and cashed in with 75 in the final one-dayer against Australia.",
            "He made his Test debut in Sri Lanka in September 2005, and made 51 in his second match. He also got starts in all the one-day games, but converted only one into a fifty. Then in April 2006 he exploded in sensational fashion against the might of Australia, stroking his way to a brilliant hundred, his maiden first-class ton as well as his first in Tests, at Fatullah. His stunning 138, with 19 fours, set up a scarcely believable first-day total of 355 for 5 as the Aussies reeled. He added 33 in the second innings, and a brisk 79 in the second Test to show that this was no flash in the pan.",
            "Nafees was appointed vice-captain for the Champions Trophy in India in October with the view of grooming a successor for Habibul Bashar. He also won the Bangladesh's cricketer-of-the-year award for 2006. He proved that the accolade wasn't wasted on him by scoring a hundred against Zimbabwe but failed against tougher opposition in the Champions Trophy. His batting was instrumental in Bangladesh's 5-0 rout over Zimbabwe in December 2006. His batting form slipped the following year and in 2008, joined the Bangladesh exodus to the ICL, He was subsequently handed a 10-year ban by the BCB but revived his international hopes when he cancelled his contract the following year. He was recalled for the tri-series at home in January 2010. Prior to joining the ICL, he opted out of a tour of Australia to concentrate on finishing his MBA program."

            "Jade Dernbach is a very modern cricketer. Earrings in both ears, tattoos covering each arm and words to accompany each delivery. His bowling is a merry-go-round of variations with slower-balls, quicker slower-balls, yorkers and bouncers as well as, crucially, an ability to touch 90mph. His variety, alongside a deep well of confidence that helps him hold his nerve, often at the most demanding times, made him a regular part of England's limited-overs teams for three years, although his penchant for over-exuberant celebrations - he has been known to run the length of the ground after getting wickets in dead first-class matches - have been widely mocked. ",
            "That mocking was a cross he had to bear - an extravagant appearance meant he did not blend into the background easily - but when his England career stalled - he was last seen at World Twenty20 in Chittagong in 2014 when he ran into AB de Villiers, a man on a mission - he contributed to Surrey's re-emergence as one of England's strongest counties with great passion and was a ready source of encouragement and advice for the next generation. He has been a more thoughtful cricketer than many have imagined.",
            "His accent reflected a journeyed background. Born in South Africa but a graduate of the Surrey Academy, Dernbach became Surrey's youngest debutant for 30 years when - at the age of 17 - he played against India A in 2003. In 2005 he was thrust into the spotlight when selected to play against Lancashire in the semi-final of the Twenty20 Cup, although with figures of 0 for 52, he was clearly under-prepared. His first-team chances were limited thereafter, although he showed some potential in the 2nd XI.",
            "A spell in Australia, playing grade cricket in Sydney for Randwick/Petersham, helped to improve his all-round game and his first hint of international recognition came in 2009 when he was called up to the ECB Fast Bowling Programme in Florida and Chennai. He was part of the Performance squad during the Ashes winter in 2010-11, and was playing in the Caribbean for England Lions when he heard of his call-up to the World Cup squad, as a replacement for Ajmal Shahzad. Though he didn't play in England's disappointing campaign he made his T20 and ODI debuts the following summer and established himself as an important part of the side.",
            "However, even after than 50 international appearances, he was still fighting for full acceptance. Impressive performances have been grossly outweighed, in terms of publicity, by his mishaps. He had the ignominy of possessing some of the worst economy rates of all time in ODIs and T20 internationals and a desperate showing at the World T20 looked to have halted his England career in its tracks. By the end of 2014, he was not even an automatic selection for Surrey in Championship cricket, and was embarrassed to concede 56 in four overs of the T20 Blast semi-final. He reportedly considered leaving Surrey after his initial contractual demands were rejected, but ultimately opted to remain at the club. ",
            "He not only stayed, he gained deepening respect. In 2015, he became only the third man to take a hat-trick in a Lord's final, although his 6 for 35 against Gloucestershire came in defeat, and had to endure three successive defeats in all as Surrey became perennial bridesmaids in the Lord's showcase final. Statistics insisted that in county cricket he deserved to be recognised as one of the finest List A performers of his time."

            "Jason Gillespie's bouncing mullet, hook nose and Spofforth-like glare were a pleasing constant in Australian pace attacks during the first half of the 2000s. It was a rare treat for Gillespie, who played only 52 of a possible 92 Tests after his 1996-97 debut thanks to an assortment of ailments: busted feet, stress fractures in the back, hip twinges, side strains, dicky shoulders, torn calves, aching hamstrings, groin complaints and a broken right leg. Each time he recovered and until being dropped during the 2005 Ashes he had missed only two Tests since November 2002. Through it all, in partnership with Glenn McGrath, he blossomed into one half of Australia's most statistically successful opening pair ever. \nBut if McGrath's strength was his ability to make the ball do just enough, then Gillespie's flaw is his tendency for it to do too much. No other contemporary fast man has elicited so many plays-and-misses. It explains, perhaps, along with his slightly samey length, why Gillespie never quite imposed himself as Australia's No. 1 strike bowler. Nor has he truly dominated an opposition line-up; remarkably, the most wickets he has taken in a single series is 20. Operating from a shorter reconfigured run-up, he is not so consistently quick and in England Michael Vaughan treated Australia's fifth most successful bowler like a medium-pacer. ",
            "However, few Australian fast men can have owned such deep wells of tenacity. Gillespie bowls long spells in the hottest conditions - always uncomplainingly, and always with the seam upright and the ball jagging both ways - and he showed the trait again when he promised to return to the national team and memorably achieved his aim against Bangladesh. He collected eight wickets in the two-match series, taking his Test tally to 259 while McGrath, Kasprowicz and Tait were missing, but his unforgettable moment came over 574 minutes and 425 balls. His maiden century was a magnificent, unbeaten 201 that was easily the highest score by a nightwatchman. ",
            "He is popular with team-mates and bashful with the public. He watches wrestling, listens to heavy metal and celebrated his first Test fifty with a bat ride embellished from the movie Happy Gilmore. He was more restrained while clocking off unthinkable milestones at Chittagong and it was appropriate recognition for a hardy and valuable batting approach that has also produced two unbeaten half-centuries and a priceless 26, which sealed a hard-fought draw against India in 2004-05. A second first-class century came in 2007 at Yorkshire shortly before he retained his Cricket Australia contract. Throughout the previous home season he was certain he wouldn't be rewarded, but his 30 Pura Cup wickets at 28.43 helped him to sneak into the squad as experienced back-up, ending the idea of him moving states. With no chance of a recall, he announced his retirement from first-class cricket during the 2007-08 season and signed a three-year contract with the unofficial Indian Cricket League. "

            "Kyle Abbott hails from the same area as Lance Klusener - Zululand - and that's not all the two have in common. Abbott followed Klusener as the second-most successful South Africa bowler on debut. His 7 for 29 in the first innings against Pakistan in Centurion in 2013 was a demonstration of speed and swing on a spicy surface. ",
            "In short, that is what Abbott is about. A tall, strong quick from Durban, his ability to bowl at pace and generate movement is what got him noticed. He began his career in the 2008-09 season for the Kwa-Zulu Natal provincial side and then represented the Dolphins franchise immediately thereafter.",
            "He was recognised by national selectors when he was picked to play List-A matches against Bangladesh A, but remained on the fringes until 2012, when he was again called up to play 50-over matches against Sri Lanka A.",
            "In the summer that Klusener took over as Dolphins' coach, Abbott's longer-form game developed and he was the leading wicket-taker in the first-class competition in the 2012-13 season with 49 scalps at an average of 15.36. His performances earned him a place in the South African Invitation XI to play the touring Pakistanis and it was against them that he made his Test debut.",
            "Abbott was included in South Africa's squad for the third Test of the series and made his debut after Jacques Kallis suffered a calf injury. He ripped through Pakistan, taking 9 for 68 in the match - the third-best match figures by a South African on debut.",
            "Abbott struggled for a regular Test spot in an attack whose regular quicks included Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander, and instead made a name for himself in limited-overs matches, where he accepted the responsibility of bowling at the death. While that did not always guarantee him a place in the side, he traveled with South Africa to the 2015 World Cup and found himself thrust into a bigger role when Philander picked up a hamstring injury.",
            "He played in half of South Africa's six group stage matches and the quarter-final and was their most successful bowler in terms of strike-rate and economy. But he was left out of the semi-final XI in favour of the fit-again Philander, a decision that was later revealed as having been partly politically motivated. He went on to feature more regularly in the ODI and T20 teams and was also part of the side that played in the 2016 World T20.",
            "Later that year, however, frustrated by the lack of certainty over his place, Abbott signed a three-year Kolpak deal with Hampshire to start in 2017. He did not inform Cricket South Africa or his team-mates until he got wind of that the news was going to break during the New Year's Test at Newlands. ",
            "By then, Abbott was a first-choice pick in the Test team because of injuries to Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel and had played four matches in succession. He was also a preferred option for the one-day side and was being primed to open the bowling at the Champions Trophy. "

His international career has had two clear phases: the first, when he debuted amid the state of emergency in Zimbabwean cricket that came after the sacking of the 15 'rebel' players and the second, when he returned to Zimbabwe an older, wiser bowler ahead of the 2010-11 season. ",
            "Panyangara made his international debut at just 18 years old, when he should have been studying for his A levels but was instead opening the bowling against Sanath Jayasuriya. Though it arrived too early, even before his debut it was clear that Panyangara would eventually play for the national side - he'd come to attention on the world stage with a remarkable bowling performance of 6 for 31 that dismantled Australia at the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in February 2004.",
            "But he lasted less than a year in the national set-up before, in early 2005, he developed a stress fracture in his back that kept him away from competitive cricket for a year.  He left Zimbabwe for England, eventually resurfacing as an opening bowler for West Indian Cavaliers, a club side in the Nottinghamshire Premier League. He was a yard slower but, in swing-friendly English conditions, increasingly adept at moving the ball through the air and off the pitch.",
            "Panyangara returned to Zimbabwe in 2010 and slotted almost immediately into the A side. He missed out on a spot in Zimbabwe's team for the Test return against Bangladesh in August 2011 but played an integral role in Zimbabwe's historic win over Pakistan in September 2013. With form, fitness and greener pastures overseas clearing away much of his fast-bowling competition, Panyangara played for Zimbabwe much more regularly in the seasons that followed. He settled into his role as one of the team's senior seamers with aplomb and was known as a lighthearted presence in the dressing room. "

But after some good domestic results he found a place on the 2010 England tour as Kamran Akmal's understudy, and when the senior keeper's lapses became too frequent, Haider was given a Test debut at Edgbaston. He was out to his first ball feathering a catch behind, but his characterful and determined 88 in the second innings formed the basis of a fightback. ",

Four years later, at the Under-19 World Cup in Dhaka, he scored a vital 23 not out from 18 balls, and claimed three catches, as Pakistan took the title in the final against West Indies. "

Not a huge turner of the cricket ball, his accuracy and consistency, as well as exploiting the rough marks, does it for him not only at the domestic circuit but at the elite level as well.",
            "Rehman's rise to fame goes way back to 1999 when he grabbed a five-for and a six-wicket haul in successive matches while representing Pakistan Under-19 against South Africa in 1999. He was picked for the side even though he only had a brace of first-class outings. His performance in domestic competitions have been notable, especially during the 2006-07 season where he ended up as the highest wicket-taker in the Pentangular Cup including an 11-wicket haul for champions Habib Bank Limited in the penultimate match of the season.",
            "In the early years, Rehman's opportunities on the international circuit were limited, partly because of the abundance of spinners in the line-up, and partly because he was believed to lack the artillery to cause major concern to batsmen in Test matches. Rehman's Test debut was an auspicious one - he took eight wickets at home against South Africa in 2007 - but played only one more Test before being dropped for three years. Upon his return in 2010, he carved a more permanent place for himself as Pakistan opted for a twin-spin attack in Tests. He showed that he deserved a place too, reaching the 50-wicket mark in only his 11th Test."

Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australia's Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame.",

But the observers who had seen something in Hazlewood were to be justified, as he statistically kept pace with McGrath, or near enough to it, during the early stages of his international career.

England were forced to pick a completely new squad at short notice after a number of Covid-19 cases were detected in their initial group leaving Mahmood to take the new ball in the first ODI in Cardiff; he dismissed Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam inside three balls, finished with 4 for 42, and was named player of the series as England romped to a 3-0 win.",
            "Mahmood's powerful physique and impressive pace meant that the ECB have kept close tabs on him since his teenage years, and he earned a maiden England call-up after an impressive 2019 season for Lancashire. While able to move the new ball with conventional swing and seam movement, Mahmood stands out most when reversing the ball later in an innings, and has been clocked at 90mph/145kph.",
            "Born in Birmingham but raised in Rochdale, Mahmood played for England Under-19s as a 17-year-old and quickly became a regular, leading the attack with gusto in the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2016 - only two bowlers took more wickets in the competition. While opportunities were often scarce for Lancashire, he remained in the ECB's thoughts, taking part in a fast-bowling camp in Potchefstroom to prepare for the 2017 summer before being named in the Lions squad to shadow the Ashes party in Australia the following winter.",
            "A side strain meant he missed almost all of the 2018 summer, but he returned to Lions duty that winter, though visa hold-ups, caused in part by his Pakistani heritage, meant he missed the series against India A. He was player of the tournament in the 2019 One-Day Cup, leading the wicket-taking charts with 28, and his form across all formats meant a call-up to England's Test and T20I squads for the New Zealand tour in 2019-20 - plus a pace-bowling development contract, which gave him access to the ECB's S&C staff and nutritionists.",
            "Mahmood was expensive in his three T20Is on that tour but enjoyed working with Darren Gough, who imparted some wisdom regarding reverse-swing and presented him with his ODI cap in Johannesburg in early 2020. He slipped down the white-ball pecking order after a disappointing summer that year but turned up at the PSL in 2021 with a point to prove and was the competition's leading wicket-taker when it was interrupted by Covid.",
            "He remained on the fringes of England's squads that summer across formats and impressed for Lancashire in his sporadic Championship appearance, taking a maiden first-class five-for during a spell with the old ball in a Roses win against Yorkshire."

He used to play a couple of club games at the start of the season, a handful at the end, and in between travel the world pursuing his other passion, skiing. He was no run-of-the-mill ski bum - he competed for several years in World Cup skiing events and narrowly missed selection for the Australian Winter Olympics team in the late 1990s. But when he started to take his cricket seriously, he quickly grabbed the attention of Victoria's selectors. It led to a first-class debut at 29 in 2005-06, and in his second game he suffered the group humiliation of watching Queensland storm to 6 for 900 declared in the Pura Cup final.",
            "A persistent shoulder injury picked up during a stint in English club cricket limited him to one match the following summer, but in 2007-08 Nannes enjoyed his most productive season. A genuinely quick left-arm bowler who can swing the ball late, Nannes collected 22 Pura Cup wickets at 28.54, although he was again part of a demoralised, unsuccessful Victoria side in the decider. There was more joy in the Twenty20, where he was instrumental in the Bushrangers winning the title. Nannes destroyed Western Australia with 4 for 23 in the final, and his promising FR Cup season - 11 wickets at 20.54 - hinted that he would be a big part of Victoria's attack moving forward. ",
            "Nannes was Middlesex's spearhead when they won the domestic Twenty20 cup in 2008, and with his stock as a limited-overs bowler rising with every game, he was signed by the Delhi Daredevils before the 2009 edition of the IPL - and chose his franchise over Victoria, his state side, when both teams made it to the Champions League that year. ",
            "Nannes gave up hope of playing for Australia after being overlooked for the World Twenty20 in England in 2009. Instead, he turned out for Netherlands (he is the son of Dutch migrant parents and carries a Dutch passport) and was part of the side that shocked England in the tournament opener. Though he went wicketless in that game, he was soon on Australia's radar, making his debut in an ODI against Scotland at Edinburgh. Quickly establishing himself as one of Twenty20 cricket's leading bowlers in the international arena, Nannes was the leading wicket-taker at the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean in May 2010, picking up 14 scalps at 13.07.

            "Less than two seasons after fast bowler Umesh Yadav first played with a leather ball, he was bowling against the likes of Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman in the Duleep Trophy. What makes his ascent even more remarkable is that he represents unglamorous Vidarbha in the Plate League of the Ranji Trophy. Yadav is the son of a coal-mine worker and was aiming to become a policeman. He only started considering a career in cricket as a 19-year-old, an age by which the best young Indian cricketers are in the running for a national cap. ",
            "As a fast bowler, he has many skills: he regularly bowls at over 140kph, moves the ball both ways, and has a pretty effective bouncer. These qualities helped him take 20 wickets at 14.60 in four games for Vidarbha in his debut season in 2008-09. While he made waves in the domestic scene, Umesh really caught the eye during IPL 2010, where he impressed a much wider audience with his pace for Delhi Daredevils. He finally broke into the big league, when he was flown to the West Indies as a replacement for the injured Praveen Kumar during the World Twenty20 tournament in May 2010, and earned his first call-up to the India Test team for the tour of South Africa in November the same year. He made the Test playing XI for the first time against West Indies in Delhi in November 2011, and picked up nine wickets in his first two Tests, which in turn earned him a place for the Australia tour. ",
            "On that tour, a disastrous one for India, Umesh was one of few positives for the side, outbowling his more experienced team-mates to finish with 14 wickets from four Tests and a strike rate of 50.50. More than his figures though, it was his speed and aggression that stood out. However, 2012 was an injury-prone year for him: he picked up a shin injury in Australia, before being ruled out one Test into the England series at the end of the year with back trouble. He returned to international cricket in June 2013 at the Champions Trophy in England, and a fast-bowler starved India would have heaved a collective sigh of relief to notice he had not lost his ability to bowl quick."

There were also various issues with knees, feet and other body parts, but Bond's desire to play could never be questioned. Some of the trouble came from his unwillingness to reduce his intensity; had he been happy to drop his pace and take things easier, he might have played more cricket. ",

His athletic action was geared towards inswing and his 150-plus kph efforts meant the ball would swing late. Toe-crushing yorkers were a specialty and he feasted on the world's best batsmen; Ricky Ponting fell to Bond in all of the first six ODIs they played against each other. Bond always lifted against Australia, and it was a sign of his great skill that he took 44 ODI wickets at 15.79 against them.

A viral infection in his right shoulder restricted him to two wicketless outings at his first World Cup but his promising start was enough to earn him a national contract for 2007-08 and a place at the ICC World Twenty20 where he claimed six wickets and destroyed Kenya with 4 for 7.

Imam ul Haq answered that question emphatically right at the get-go, stopping conspiracy theorists and cynics who cried nepotism - his uncle is chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq - with a glorious start to his international career. A hundred against Sri Lanka on debut made him the second player from Pakistan to reach three figures in his first match. He followed that up with a splendid outing in Zimbabwe, where he scored three centuries and became the first player in ODI history to score four hundreds in his first nine matches.",

A left-handed opening batsman descended from arguably Pakistan's greatest batsman of all time, Imam is particularly strong on the drive and off his hips. He looks to have faith in his abilities even in high-pressure moments, though he is admittedly yet to be tested in truly demanding conditions or the highest quality of opposition; he was unwittingly done a favour when he was benched for most of Pakistan's disastrous ODI tour of New Zealand at the start of 2018."

Then, in only his third Test, he notched a hat-trick, eking out the last three Sri Lankans in the Asian Test Championship final and he also has an ODI hat-trick. But since those early years, and especially after the World Cup 2003, when he was expected to become the Pakistan spearhead after the retirements of Wasim and Waqar, his story has been a fitful and thus far disappointing one.",

For the most part Sami has been surprisingly ineffective and prone to leaking runs. So poor was his form after the India series in early 2006, he was finally dropped from the tour to Sri Lanka yet was lucky to be selected for the tour to England that summer, after a number of Pakistan's frontline bowlers were injured.",
            "Nobody seems to be entirely sure where the problem lies either - he has been given the new-ball with license to attack, he has come on as first-change. He is fit - one of the fittest in the team - and athletic. From a shortish run-up and high action he generates surprising pace, settled in the mid-to-late eighties but  with occasional forays into the nineties. He also quickly mastered traditional outswing and reverse-swing and bowls a mean yorker. "

            "An out-and-out fast bowler, Morne Morkel stands at 1.96 metres tall and his height allows him to generate steepling and awkward bounce. At the peak of his powers, he used a combination of speed - in the upper 140 kph range - and skill to form part of South Africa's most potent pace pack. ",
            "Son of Albert and brother of Malan and Albie, all cricketers in their own right, Morkel is undoubtedly his family's most successful sportsman. He has ranked in the ICC's top 10 bowlers in the world in all formats at some stage of his career and was No. 1 in ODIs for a period in 2011. ",
            "Morkel cut his teeth at Easterns and rose to prominence in the 2006-07 season when he was picked for a Rest of South Africa side against the touring Indians. His 4 for 74 in Potchefstroom - a notoriously flat pitch - earned him a Test call-up and he made his debut in that series.",
            "He spent 2007 trying to establish himself in international cricket and broke through in 2008. Morkel was the joint leading wicket-taker on South Africa's tour of England and played a key part in their first series win there since readmission. He did not take the same form into 2009 and was dropped for the final Test in a home series against Australia. ",
            "Morkel honed his game and returned the next year, after Makhaya Ntini's retirement, to share the new ball with Dale Steyn, and had great success. He took Test 49 wickets in 2010, his highest in a calendar year. The following year he had ODI success, taking 26 wickets at 17.65 in three series which included the World Cup. ",
            "His share of the spoils decreased after that, when South Africa added Vernon Philander to the Test pack and Morkel was moved to first-change. He was part of the South African side that dethroned England to claim the Test mace and contributed more than he received recognition for. Morkel was the top wicket-taker on the 2012 tour to Australia, where South Africa successfully defended the No. 1 ranking. ",
            "Morkel also enjoyed bragging rights over some of the world's best batsmen. No bowler has dismissed Michael Hussey more times - eight - than Morkel and only Shane Warne had the better of Andrew Strauss as many times as Morkel - also eight. ",
            "The subcontinent was, expectedly, more challenging for Morkel but he showed skills development when he led the attack during the 2015 tour of India. In the absence of Steyn and Philander, both injured, Morkel conjured up a spell of reverse-swing in Nagpur that was among the only highlights for South Africa in a 3-0 series defeat. ",
            "With Test cricket a priority, Morkel's ODI and T20 career was managed and he was kept out of several bilateral series while being brought back for major tournaments. He was South Africa's leading wicket-taker in the 2015 World Cup."

            "From the moment Shoaib emerged on the scene in the late 90s, the world knew it was in for some career. First there was the extreme pace and there was also the attitude; Shoaib was the fastest bowler in the world, he knew it, he made sure others knew it. He was a natural successor to the legacy of Imran, Wasim and Waqar. But that he will end his career an 'if only' or a 'coulda been' is the great tragedy. He had it all and he blew it.",
            "What he had was remarkable. Early on, in 1999, there wasn't a more thrilling sight in the world than Shoaib hurtling in off an impossibly long run and beating the world's best batsmen for pace. Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar were clean bowled off successive deliveries at Eden Gardens and the World Cup in England later in the year was all but Shoaib's.",
            "Other peaks came intermittently, but from 2004 to 2006, he rediscovered a spark; the trophy was the home series win over England in 2005-06 in which he took 17 wickets. By this time not only was he still very, very quick, but he had become an extremely smart bowler, an oft-underrated aspect of his development.",

The list of misdemeanours is impossibly long; doubts about his action, ball-tampering offences, beating up his own team-mates, courtroom battles against his board, long bans and heavier fines, serious career-threatening injuries and most damagingly, doping charges. In his time, he missed more than half of the Tests Pakistan played."

Extreme pace, the ability to swing the ball both ways, and accuracy have perhaps made him the country's best ever. At the peak of his powers, Steyn possessed a lithe and wiry body, a steaming run-up that culminated in a aerodynamic action, and a ripper of an outswinger.",
            "Steyn grew up in Phalaborwa, in the country's northern-most province, and spent his childhood obsessed with skateboarding. It was only when he moved to a bigger city, Pretoria, that he gave cricket a proper go and it did not take long before he was considered a serious prospect. He played just seven first-class matches before he was selected for South Africa and made his debut against England in 2004, in the same match as AB de Villiers. ",
            "He did not have an immediate impact and spent the following winter playing for Essex in Division 2 of the county championship, and the 2005-06 season honing his craft in the domestic set-up before he was recalled, a visibly fiercer bowler. Steyn took 16 wickets in his second series, against New Zealand, but it was only when he faced them the next year, in the 2007-08 summer, that he announced himself as one of the fierce fast men. ",
            "A visibly fired-up Steyn took ten wickets in the first Test in Johannesburg. Then, shortly after lunch on the first day of the second Test in Centurion, he delivered a short ball to Craig Cumming, who missed. The ball crashed into his face and sent him to intensive care. ",
            "The flow of wickets became a gush, and in 2008, he became the fastest South African at the time, and the 15th fastest overall, to reach 100 Test wickets. That September, Steyn was named ICC Test Player of the Year after taking 86 wickets in 14 matches at an average of 18.10. ",
            "He was part of the South African side that beat England and Australia for the first time away from home since readmission, and then proved he could do it on the subcontinent. In 2010, Steyn summoned reverse-swing reminiscent of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and took 7 for 51 as South Africa beat India in Nagpur. ",
            "He went on to win the Test championship with the team in England in 2012 and took his 300th Test wicket the following year, against New Zealand. He was only the fourth South African to rack up that many scalps. ",
            "After he turned 30, Steyn's injury-free run ended. He suffered a groin strain in the Champions Trophy in June 2013, a side strain later that year and a rib fracture in early 2014, a year in which he had three hamstrings strains but also played a part in South Africa's first Test series win in Sri Lanka in over two decades.",
            "He led South Africa's attack at the 2015 World Cup but also became the face of their failed campaign. He delivered the final over in the semi-final against New Zealand and was hit for six by Grant Elliott off the penultimate ball."

            "After years of being consistently on the fringes of the national set-up, Marcus North's chance came when he was picked in Australia's squad for the 2008-09 tour of South Africa, and he scored a century on debut in the first Test at the Wanderers. He had impressed the selectors with his ability to prosper on difficult pitches - his offspin also helped his cause - and it was just reward for one of Western Australia's most reliable performers. Having started with a vital 117 as Australia's batsmen struggled in the opening match, he scored another 38 runs in three innings and picked up two wickets to show his part-time bowling value. Instead of appearing in the third Test, he spent the opening day sick in hospital, but stayed for the one-day series when Adam Voges pulled out. He also went to the United Arab Emirates via Hampshire to cover for Shaun Marsh, failing twice in the ODIs against Pakistan. ",
            "The 2009 Ashes was the series for his most accomplished performances at Test level, which included an unbeaten 125 in Cardiff and back-to-back returns of 96 and 110 in Birmingham and Leeds. He also had five scores of 12 or less to highlight his strange hit-and-miss tendency, and his life was made harder by being the main spinner in the decider at The Oval. Back in Australia for his first local Test experience, North was soon struggling and his position was in doubt after only 207 runs in six Tests against West Indies and Pakistan. ",
            "Under immense pressure, he went to New Zealand, immediately fixed a damaging technical glitch and picked up 112, 9 and 90 in the two-Test series. \"It was a pretty defining couple of innings for my career,\" he said. However, he faltered again with the bat in the series against Pakistan in England, although he managed to get on the honour boards at Lord's with 6 for 55 in the second innings. ",
            "A well-organised left-hander, North was afflicted by a casual attitude in his initial seasons with Western Australia as he made the transition from decorated youth player to senior squad member. He had significant success at under-age level, having been a member of several Academy and national junior sides and an elite scholar in 1998. He is particularly well remembered for a remarkable double of 200 and 134 at Sheikhupura during an Australian Youth team's tour of Pakistan in early 1997. His debut at first-class level came in 1998-99 on an Academy tour of Zimbabwe, and he quickly showcased his potential upon his elevation to senior interstate ranks the following season, hitting a brave 60 to help his team to a tense win over South Australia.

He made an immediate impact in his first ODI, in 2009, taking match-winning figures of 4 for 33 against Sri Lanka, though it took 19 matches after that debut four-for before he bettered that showing, with 4 for 25 against New Zealand at the same venue, Mirpur.",
            "Rubel began by playing tape-ball cricket in his hometown, Bagerhat in south-west Bangladesh, and his talents came to wider notice through a fast-bowler-hunt programme in which he topped the speed gun. He made his cricket debut in 2007, against Khulna Division, for whom his hero Mashrafe Mortaza, who later captained Rubel in internationals, played. ",
            "Rubel started his Test career like he had his ODI one, taking three wickets in his first Test innings (but none through the remainder of that Test tour to West Indies). About six months later, his first and only Test five-for reduced New Zealand to 158 for 5 in Hamilton, though they recovered to post a big total and eventually a crushing win. Rubel's best ODI performance too came against New Zealand, in Mirpur, when he took 6 for 26 in his side's win in the first ODI of the 2013 home series, which they went on to win 3-0. Three and a bit months later, he produced his most sustained run in the format, taking seven wickets in three matches against Sri Lanka, also in Mirpur. In T20Is too, he reserved his best for New Zealand, against whom he took consecutive three-wicket hauls in Mount Maunganui early in 2017. In domestic T20, Rubel has most frequently turned out for Dhaka Dominators and Rangpur Riders in the BPL, but he excelled when he moved to Sylhet Strikers in 2023, taking 14 wickets in eight games.\n"

            "For three seasons, Sreesanth was hardly anything more than an answer to a trivia question - who is the only Kerala bowler to have taken a Ranji Trophy hat-trick ? His rise, though, was rapid, and since he played for a weak side, unnoticed. Not too many bowlers get selected for the Duleep Trophy in their first season, like Sreesanth did in 2002-03 after snapping up 22 wickets in his first seven games. ",
            "His progress was halted owing to a hamstring injury in the following year, but he returned stronger, with a more side-on action and increased pace, and a superb display in the Challenger Trophy, in 2005, propelled him to the national squad for the Sri Lanka series. In the last game of his impressive debut season, he snapped up 6 for 55 against England. ",
            "Idiosyncratic, with an aggressive approach - to the stumps and the game - he can be expensive in one-dayers, but is also a wicket-taking bowler. He does it in Tests, too - in Antigua in June 2006 he fired out Ramnaresh Sarwan and Brian Lara (for 0) in successive overs, and then took five wickets in Jamaica and played a key role in bowling India to a historic triumph. The year was one of several highlights, including a haul of eight wickets against South Africa in Johannesburg, which helped India win their first Test in the country.",
            "However, things turned sour two years later in the inaugural IPL, when he was involved in a spat with Harbhajan Singh, who slapped him at the end of a match. Sreesanth signed with Warwickshire and enjoyed a satisfactory first season, but injuries and a steady decline in form kept him out of the national team. His problems with discipline are well documented; he was warned by the BCCI with suspension from domestic cricket if he violated the code of conduct. But his ability with the ball continued to keep him in contention for a place in the Indian team in Tests and ODIs."

            "Jofra Archer has rapidly become one of the most exciting young fast bowlers in English cricket. Born in Barbados to an English father and Bajan mother, the possibility of his inclusion in England's 2019 World Cup squad became subject of much speculation in the run-up to the tournament. Changes to the ECB's qualification rules led to him becoming eligible after three years of residency - rather than the expected seven - and he was quickly given his chance at international level.",
            "Archer had declared his intention to play for England soon after moving to the country, taking advantage of his British passport. He impressed with Sussex, as well as in T20 leagues around the world, and made his debut in an ODI against Ireland. It only took a couple of performances - he picked up 2 for 29 in a T20I against Pakistan, followed by 1 for 6 from four overs of precision pace in an abandoned ODI - to convince England of his value at the World Cup, never mind concerns that his promotion might ruffle feathers among the fast-bowling group.",
            "They were right to put faith in him. Archer was the most prolific England bowler, taking 20 wickets over a gruelling six-week tournament, and was entrusted with bowling the most important over in England's limited-overs history in the final at Lord's. New Zealand needed 7 off 4 to claim the trophy after Jimmy Neesham heaved the second legitimate ball of Archer's Super Over for six, but he held his nerve. Martin Guptill was run out attempting a second run off his final delivery, a leg-stump yorker, and Archer charged towards the Tavern Stand in celebration.",
            "England knew they had a special talent on their hands, and Archer made an immediate impact in Test cricket, too. On debut, he reached speeds of 96mph against Australia at Lord's, striking both Steven Smith and his concussion replacement Marnus Labuschagne on the helmet. He took 22 wickets in the series, having missed the first Test, including six-fors at Lord's and Headingley.",
            "But England couldn't resist the temptation to throw the ball to Archer. On a lifeless pitch at Mount Maunagnui in late 2019, he bowled 42 overs in a single innings and his heavy workload seemed to have a long-lasting effect. He reported various niggles over the next 18 months and in 2021, had surgery on his elbow. After an aborted initial comeback, he then suffered a lower-back stress fracture just as he was about to return; in all, he spent nearly two years out of international cricket before a return in early 2023.",
            "Archer's talent was obvious as he set about following his friend and fellow Bajan Chris Jordan into the England set-up. It was Jordan who first alerted Sussex to Archer's talents after facing him in a net session in Barbados and his assessment that \"the sky is the limit\" has been borne out by batting and bowling spells of great promise.",
            "Archer, a silky fast bowler with a high action capable of speeds above 90mph, and dangerous lower-order hitter, played for West Indies Under-19s in 2013 but after suffering a serious back injury he slipped out of the Barbados system. Instead, he rallied while playing for Sussex's 2nd XI and for Horsham in the Sussex Premier League.",
            "Archer claimed four scalps on his first-class bow against Pakistan before collecting a maiden five-wicket haul in a Royal London Cup defeat to Somerset. He had been playing without a contract because of a long-term back injury, but Sussex acted quickly to secure him for longer. He made a powerful impression when he broke into Sussex's Championship side in the latter half of 2016, making his debut in all three formats and taking 35 wickets in all, 23 of them at 30 runs apiece in Division Two to bring cheer to a mundane Sussex season. He also wasted no time showing his potential with the bat as he struck 72 batting at No. 8 on debut against Essex."

In the process, he played for more than 25 teams, including four English counties, three South African franchises and an IPL team while carving a reputation as one of the best limited-overs' legspinners of his time. A feisty character with a celebration longer than most fast-bowlers' run-ups and a range of variations, Tahir made the googly his biggest weapon in the limited-overs formats.",
            "That was not always what Tahir was being primed for. When he arrived in South Africa, after meeting his wife Sumayya during the 1998 Under-19 World Cup, he established himself in the first-class set-up. He was the third highest wicket-taker in the 2008-09 first-class competition and was called up to the South African Test squad in January 2010 during their home series against England.",
            "However, later the same day the decision was overturned after it became clear Tahir was not yet eligible to play for South Africa. Tahir went back to the domestic circuit and consistently picked up wickets in the 2010-11 season, when he also became a citizen. Less than a week after he was naturalised, he was picked in South Africa's squad for the one-dayers against India. But he had to wait until the 2011 World Cup for his debut and he made an immediate impact. He finished the tournament as South Africa's second-highest wicket-taker. ",
            "That summer, Tahir made his Test debut against Australia in Cape Town, in the same match as Vernon Philander. Despite all the hype around how he would complete South Africa's attack, Tahir struggled for the same success he had at the domestic level in a pace-heavy pack and on pitches unsuitable for his style of bowling. In his 11th Test, against Australia in Adelaide in November 2012, it seemed the experiment was over. Tahir's figures were 0 for 260, the most expensive returns without a wicket in Test history, and he was dropped.",
            "He remained out of contention in all formats until South Africa's tour to the UAE in October 2013, where he would play against his former countrymen. Tahir took his first Test five-for in Dubai but it did not earn him a more permanent place. Instead, he carved a niche for himself in the shorter formats, where he showed much more control with his craft. "

Sri Lanka's selectors were attracted by his specialist limited-over skills and his huge experience as they tried to strengthen the middle order. He later graduated up the order in T20 cricket for Wayamba, the domestic T20 champions in both 2009 and 2010, carving out a reputation for being one of the most destructive match-winners. In the 2010 season, he finished the third-highest scorer with 277 runs at 69.25 including a 152.19 run strike rate. He was also the first Sri Lankan to score a T20 hundred in domestic cricket and was named Player of the Tournament. "

He was always considered good enough to be in the senior team's preliminary squad but hardly ever made the final XI. Muktar's international debut came in a T20I against Zimbabwe in January 2016 but it went by without a spark, wicketless and just one six hit in a tough chase.",

He has been a regular performer for Rajshahi Division in the NCL, especially with the ball. He took 32 wickets in the 2011-12 season, his best in terms of wickets, while with the bat, in 2013-14, he crossed the 400-run mark in a single NCL tournament for the first and only time so far.",

            "Few bowlers can thank Sachin Tendulkar for making them look good but Aaron Phangiso, an unassuming left-arm spinner from Garankuwa, could. In the 2012 edition of the Champions League T20, Tendulkar was among the 10 wickets Phangiso claimed to finish third on the overall wicket-takers' list and, after eight years as a domestic workhorse, caught the attention of the global cricket world. ",
            "That summer, Phangiso was rewarded with a call-up to South Africa's limited-overs' squads and made his T20 and ODI debut in a series against New Zealand. Being neither a great turner of the ball nor a master of variations, Phangiso uses what his coach Grant Morgan called a \"natural pause\" in his action to operate primarily as a containing bowler. Phangiso essentially stops for a millisecond mid-stride before delivering the ball which makes him more difficult to pick. ",
            "His bowling technique was honed during his five-season stint at Northerns, after which he moved to North West. At his provincial side, Phangiso played in all formats but when he earned promotion to the franchise team, the Lions, he was primarily used in limited-overs cricket. His economy of under five runs an over in List A cricket and under seven runs an over in T20s is testament to his strangling style. ",
            "Where Phangiso was unlucky was that his rise coincided with that of other spinners turning heads both at his franchise and in the country. At the Lions, Phangiso competed with his international team-mate Imran Tahir for a regular place as well as with younger players such as Dale Deeb and Eddie Leie. Despite the tough competition, Phangiso carved a niche as the first-choice spinner for the Lions in shorter formats but struggled to do the same at international level. ",
            "Phangiso was part of South Africa's squad at the 2015 World Cup but was the only player in the 15-man traveling party who did not play a game. His year improved when he was named in all three South African squads to tour Bangladesh in July 2015, which included a maiden call-up to the Test team. "

Few backed him then despite some impressive early performances and he was dropped soon after, allegedly because of disciplinary problems. But with continuing ambiguity over Shoaib Akhtar's part in the Pakistan team and injuries to other bowlers, Rana worked his way back as an essential cog in the ODI team. ",
            "As with most Pakistan bowlers of pace, he can bowl a reverse-swinging yorker almost at will. His change of pace is another useful weapon. But his nous with the ball, his control over line and length and his absolute refusal to consider giving anything less than his all in the field has stood out. ",
            "His Test appearances remain limited and largely unsuccessful, though he bowled well when England visited in 2005-06. His form in 2006 fell away drastically, possibly due to a groin injury he picked up at Sussex, and with the return of Umar Gul, his position was in some doubt. But as Pakistan continued to struggle with finding a fit fast bowler, he managed to hold on to his place for the World Cup, despite a disastrous South African tour. A disappointing tournament saw him dropped from Pakistan's plans immediately thereafter though Sussex continued to show faith, justifiably. As a lower-order, hard-hitting batsman, he has had little opportunity to impress, despite his insistence that he is, in fact, a natural wicketkeeper batsman. And he gave up his first love, hockey, for cricket."

Although he has struggled to gain much traction at first-class level for South Australia, Richardson is very effective in the shorter forms and in 2019 was a late addition to the World Cup squad.",

His breakthrough international performance came in January 2016, when he picked up five wickets in a Man of the Match effort against India in Canberra. He played Australia's next ODI in New Zealand but did not play another for 18 months before returning on the 2017 ODI tour of India. "

            "- Anrich Nortje was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the IPL 2019 auction for his base price of INR 20 lakh but a shoulder injury ruled him out that season.",
            "- Nortje was released by KKR ahead of IPL 2020 and initially went unsold at the auction. He was then signed up by Delhi Capitals (DC) as a replacement player for Chris Woakes.\n- Nortje made an immediate impact with his bustling pace, clocking speeds in excess of 155kph on more occasions than one. Nortje finished IPL 2021 with 22 wickets, the fourth highest that year.",
            "- Nortje didn't play the first half of IPL 2021, which was held in India, but had an excellent second half when the tournament resumed in the UAE, picking 12 wickets in eight games with an economy rate of 6.16.",
            "- As a result, Nortje was retained by DC ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction. An injury restricted him to just six games in IPL 2022 where he picked up nine wickets. ",
            "- Nortje didn't have the best of times in IPL 2023, managing just ten wickets in as many games and leaking runs at 9.10. Nortje is playing for DC in IPL 2024 as well.",
            "With an ability to combine high speed with late swing, Nortje is the ideal successor to his hero Dale Steyn in South Africa's pace attack. ",
            "He set the 2018-19 Mzansi Super League ablaze, attacking the stumps at 150kph and taking eight wickets in three matches - including the dismissals of Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma and Reeza Hendricks - at an average of 10.4. That earned him an ODI debut in March 2019 as well as call-ups to the IPL and the 50-over World Cup, although injury sidelined him from the latter two tournaments.\nLater that year, he got the chance to make his Test debut in India, and his ability to bend his back on the docile tracks stood out even as South Africa slumped to one Test defeat after another. His first away five-for in Tests also came in the subcontinent, in Rawalpindi in early 2021. ",
            "Back home against England in December 2019, Nortje proved himself the find of the summer, challenging England's batters with plenty of short stuff and finishing as the leading wicket-taker with 18 in four Tests even though South Africa lost 3-1. His ability to grind it out as a nightwatch - contributing to a match-winning partnership in Centurion and batting for over three hours in Port Elizabeth - prompted South Africa's bowling coach Charl Langeveldt to nickname him a \"proper Dutchman\". ",
            "In the 2020 IPL, Nortje, playing for Delhi Capitals, clocked 156kph on the speed gun, and although Jos Buttler ramped that delivery for four, Nortje returned to bowl one of the balls of the tournament - a 155kph rocket that moved in off the seam and took out Buttler's middle stump. An improved legcutter added to his T20 variations, helping him take nine wickets at an economy of 5.3 in the 2021 T20 World Cup. ",
            "Hip and back injuries shortened his 2022 IPL, but he remained a strike force for South Africa across formats, playing the summer Tests in England and the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia, where he was the fifth-highest wicket-taker, with 11 dismissals from five games, again at an economy of 5.3, including 4 for 10 against Bangladesh.",
            "He was named the men's cricketer of the year at Cricket South Africa's awards in July 2023 - an honour he had won in 2021 as well - but disappointingly missed the 2023 ODI World Cup in India and the entire summer at home due to a stress fracture to his back.",
            "Nortje was schooled at Brandwag High in the small town of Uitenhage, north of Port Elizabeth and went on to complete a degree in financial planning at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, where he used varsity cricket to hone his skills. He enjoyed a strong start to his first-class franchise career, with 20 wickets in four matches in the 2016-17 season and a fifth-place finish on the first-class wicket charts in the 2017-18 summer. But the shortest format was where he got his big break.\n"

            "Agarkar's entry into international cricket - with an avalanche of wickets that made him the fastest to 50 in ODIs at the time - was matched for precocity only by an astonishing batting slump during which he collected seven consecutive Test ducks against Australia. But he could bat, because tailenders do not score half-centuries in 21 balls, as Agarkar did in a one-day game against Zimbabwe, or make Test hundreds at Lord's, as he did in some style in 2002. His best performance - and only Test five-for - came in a famous win for India, a match haul of 8 for 160 in Adelaide in 2003-04.",
            "His aggression was an asset, but his body could not sometimes support it. He turned into a one-day specialist, and was arguably India's most effective ODI bowler in 2005-06, but a disappointing World Cup campaign in 2007 resulted in him being dropped for the Bangladesh series that followed, and though he made it to the ODI squad that toured England in the summer of 2007, that was his last international outing. ",

            "The search for a Test-class left-armer, a universal pursuit, led Australia to Nathan Bracken five times between 2003 and 2005, but it was as a one-day player that he was at his best. After an accomplished career as a tight and testing white-ball operator, he suffered a series of serious knee injuries and, despite coming back for New South Wales, was cut from Australia's contract list in April. He vowed to continue fighting.",
            "Tall and slim, Bracken moves the ball both ways in the air and off the seam and fitted easily into Australia's rampant one-day squad in 2000-01. He was also instrumental in resuscitating New South Wales' fortunes, including a first-innings 6 for 27 in their 2004-05 final win over Queensland and 7 for 4 earlier that season when South Australia fell for 29. A shoulder injury cut short his maiden Ashes tour in 2001 after two matches, but following a spell on the sidelines he returned to the national set-up during the 2003 World Cup, when Jason Gillespie dropped out with a heel injury. ",
            "His Test debut finally came in 2003-04, but in three outings against the powerful Indian batting line-up he failed to make real inroads. In 2004 he was omitted from Cricket Australia's list of contracted players, but returned to the ODI scene for the 2005 Super Series and became a regular in green and gold. Work in the nets refining his swing was rewarded with two Tests in 2005-06 and he also added another string by delivering across the seam when he wanted to defend. ",
            "The versatility and control led to 46 ODI wickets for 2006, the second most in the world, and at times during the 2006 Champions Trophy he opened the attack, dropping Glenn McGrath to first change. In 17 matches between the South Africa tour and the end of the CB Series he picked up at least a wicket in each game and he missed only one match at the World Cup, capturing 16 victims in his second campaign. ",
            "His steady rise peaked after the 2008 West Indies tour when he became the No. 1-ranked one-day bowler, his 34 wickets in the previous home contest boosting his ratings. The West Indies series was also an important step following what could have been a career-ending knee injury. He required surgery and when the doctor scraped away the cartilage it was like \"old paint peeling off a wall\". "

            "A powerful left-hand batsman who pounces on short balls and backs his batting instincts, Luke Pomersbach made one of the most remarkable international debuts when he was called into Australia's Twenty20 side in Perth in December 2007. Brad Hodge injured his back while bending over to pull on his trousers and the call went out to Pomersbach, who was parking his car to attend the game as a spectator. After the shock subsided, he struck a six on his way to 15 from seven balls as Australia beat New Zealand, in a season when he was also named the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year. If the circumstances of his debut were not incredible enough, Pomersbach was also suspended by Western Australia at the time after a drinking session with Shaun Marsh. Unfortunately for Pomersbach, that was the trend of his time with Western Australia: off-field issues too often overshadowed his on-field exploits. Four times he was suspended by the WACA and in 2009 he escaped a jail sentence when he admitted to assaulting a police officer and drink driving. In 2011 he missed a practice match following a drinking session and subsequently announced that he would take the summer off from representing Western Australia in an effort to address his issues."

He ran out Wasim Jaffer for a duck and made a half-century on debut against Vidarbha and finished the season as Delhi's highest run-getter, with 557 runs at 50.63, including a century and three fifties. Rana attributed his big-hitting prowess to his stint with Mumbai Indians. He was bought by the franchise in the 2015 auction for INR 10 lakh but did not play a game in the IPL 2015. He was retained by Mumbai Indians ahead of the IPL 2016 auction. \n"

He had been 12th man in 1989 when Netherlands beat an England XI that included Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart - although that victory had something to do with the night before - but his chirpy presence was a constant in the field on that famous night at Lord's.

By the time he returned to his boyhood club as captain in 2021, the bowling was little more than a part-time option.",
            "But there was no doubting Borthwick's commitment to the cause of returning Durham to the top division. When that goal was achieved in 2023, he described it as his \"most special\" achievement at the club.",
            "Much had changed since his promising legspin had tempted England to hand him caps in all three formats. Borthwick's Test debut against Australia in the final Test at Sydney, as they lurched towards a 5-0 defeat, turned out to be his last international appearance. Thrown into a losing team in the wake of Graeme Swann's retirement, he claimed four wickets in the match - but he was among the many casualties of that tour and a recall remained elusive even as he began to be mentioned in dispatches for his batting.",
            "Borthwick had passed 1000 runs in a season for the first time in 2013, as Durham claimed their third Championship title in six seasons. He achieved the mark in each of the next three summers, too - only James Hildreth scored more than his 1286 Division One runs in 2015 - but his name check by the national coach, Trevor Bayliss, coincided with a collapse in form.",
            "His legspin was by now serviceable at best, although he put some of that down to the Chester-le-Street pitches. Borthwick was proud of his northeast heritage but the club was in financial disarray and after much uncertainty he followed his Durham team-mate Mark Stoneman in joining Surrey at the end of the 2016 season. He struggled initially down south but averaged 40.36 in the 2018 title-winning campaign. After being limited to red-ball cricket for the next two seasons, he negotiated a release from the final year of his Surrey contract in order to return home."

            "Finn made his county debut for Middlesex as a 16-year-old in 2005, and went on to represent England at all age-group levels from Under-16s upwards. He had a solid 2009 season for Middlesex, taking 53 wickets at 30.64 in the County Championship. He was brought in as injury cover on England's tour to Bangladesh in 2010, and impressed on his Test debut there, displaying good pace and bounce on a docile Chittagong surface. His home debut also came against Bangladesh later in the year, when he carried a rusty England attack with nine wickets at Lord's, in just his third Test.",
            "In Australia at the end of that year, he took 6 for 125 to help turn the tide in the first Test at the Gabba, before stepping into the breach left by an injury to Stuart Broad to help seal victory in in Adelaide.",
            "Finn played just one Test in 2011, though an impressive tour of India pushed him firmly into one-day contention. The following home summer, his habit of hitting the stumps in his delivery stride became costly when Graeme Smith drew attention to it at Headingley. The umpires decided to call dead ball and Finn was denied Smith's wicket. A few months later a law was created, making any wicket taken after a bowler had knocked over the stumps a no-ball.",
            "Finn's career went into reverse in 2013-14. He was sent home from England's tour of Australia after being deemed \"not selectable\". This kicked off a period when he was in and out of the side, during which endless tinkering with his action left him short of confidence. He experimented with a shortened run-up, but his rhythm had been affected.",
            "After that tumultuous winter, he rebuilt his confidence with the help of Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson and had success in the 2015 Ashes series, taking six wickets in an innings at Edgbaston. He then acquitted himself ably enough in England's series win in South Africa the following season, only for his career to take another twist when he lost his limited-overs place just as he returned to Test cricket.",
            "In 2016 he took just five wickets in two Tests against Pakistan at home, and one against Bangladesh away, and though he played a handful of ODIs the next season, that was it for his international career."

In his first List A match with them, he took 5 for 30 against Northern Districts, and then followed that with 6 for 41 in his next match, against Wellington. He took 16 wickets in six List A matches that season, and 35 in ten first-class games. His reward was a place in the New Zealand squad on the tour to South Africa in 2012-13, and in his first ODI he returned excellent figures of 4 for 20, becoming only the second New Zealander, after Dayle Hadlee, to take four wickets on ODI debut.",
            "Despite New Zealand's early exit from the 2013 Champions Trophy in England, McClenaghan had a successful tournament, picking up 11 wickets - including four-fors against Australia and Sri Lanka - at an average of 13.09. He kept up the frenetic rate of wicket-taking, and in October 2014 became the fastest New Zealand bowler - and the joint second-fastest from anywhere - to 50 ODI wickets, getting to the mark in only his 23rd match. By then he had become an important part of New Zealand's ODI attack, used in short, sharp bursts by captain Brendon McCullum and told to chase wickets rather than worrying about his economy rate.",
            "McClenaghan was part of New Zealand's squad at the 2015 World Cup, but the depth of the team's pace resources only allowed him one match during their surge to the final. The boot was on the other foot a year later at the 2016 World T20, when Tim Southee and Trent Boult did not feature even once, but McClenaghan, preferred for his ability to bowl cutters on the slower Indian surfaces, played an important role in their run to the semi-finals."

            "Alviro Petersen, a right-hand opening batsman who forged a path to Test cricket in 2010 - nine year after his professional debut. It seemed as if he had turned his back on his country in 2011 after signing a county contract with Glamorgan but was picked again at the start of 2012 and has now cemented his place at the top order in international cricket.",
            "With a cool head and a stoic, self-contained batting style, Petersen is primarily a leg-side player although he can bring out the perfect cover drive at will. On the fringes of the national side throughout 2009, an injury to Mark Boucher presented him with a Test debut against India in Calcutta. He made a century, only the third South African to do so, and didn't do too much wrong before he was dropped after the New Year's Test of 2011, also against India. He averaged 33.65 at the time and, although he had not lit up the world, he also hadn't darkened it but Jacques Rudolph's sheer weight of runs pushed Petersen out. ",
            "But Rudolph's return was unsuccessful and the selectors went back to Petersen, a century for South Africa A against Australia on a green pitch in Potchefstroom providing a compelling case.",
            "On his comeback, in the New Year's Test against Sri Lanka, exactly a year after he was dropped, Petersen scored a century to show that he belonged. A milestone followed in each of the next two series he played, both times coming when questions arose about Petersen's presence in the starting XI. His 156 in Wellington against New Zealand came after two matches in which he made little impact while his 182 against England at Headingley turned around a tour that began with 42 runs in four innings, including a duck in the first Test at the Oval.

            "Vernon Philander is a powerful allrounder who has had stunning success in his first five months in Test cricket, reaching 50 wickets in only seven matches, the second-fastest ever in Test history. Philander hails from a country famous for producing high-quality fast bowlers, and he has done everything in his first few games to keep up that tradition. His strength isn't extreme pace, but he has everything else going for him: the ability to move the ball both ways at a sharp speed, and relentlessly attack the stumps over long spells. ",
            "His promotion to the Test squad was the result of consistent performances in the domestic circuit - he got a chance to play the home series against Australia in 2011 after taking 35 wickets at an average of 16.11 in the 2010-11 domestic season - but even he wouldn't have anticipated the immediate impact he made. He started with a Man-of-the-Match performance in his first Test, taking 8 for 78, including a second-innings haul of 5 for 15, to help South Africa to a stunning win in Cape Town. He followed it up with another five-for in the second Test, winning him the Man-of-the-Series prize. The good times continued in his next two series as well, as he grabbed 16 in two Tests against Sri Lanka and then tormented New Zealand in the three Test away series. He thus had six five-fors in his first seven Tests, and reached 50 wickets only 139 days from his debut. "

            "He struggled to make a consistent impact with his bowling on the international stage and lost his place in early 2007, signalling the end of his international career. His first taste of county cricket was with Essex between 2004-6 but it was Nottinghamshire who saw the best of him. He joined them as a Kolpak player in 2008 and found the responsive seam-bowling conditions at Trent Bridge so perfect for his skills that he began a long association with the county.",
            "Adams made his Test debut against England at Auckland in 2002 and took three wickets in each innings. But a series of back injuries on the West Indies tour of 2002 allowed Jacob Oram to move ahead of him in the pecking order, and he was not selected again. He played in the 2003 World Cup but again soon lost his place. ",
            "He had a productive 2006-07 domestic season for Auckland, claiming 32 wickets at 18.78 in New Zealand's domestic first-class State Championship and scoring 318 runs at 39.75. But this was overshadowed by a one-month suspension for grabbing and shaking the helmet of Central Districts batsman Bevan Griggs. ",
            "Along the way, Adams was recalled for three ODIs against Sri Lanka in December but was overlooked for the World Cup and lost his national contract in May 2007. He was overlooked again the following season, despite impressive performances in the State Championship, and signed a two-year contract with the short-lived Indian Cricket League.",
            "In 2008, Adams joined Nottinghamshire, initially on a two-year deal. He was named the club's player of the year in consecutive seasons, after taking 68 first-class wickets as Nottinghamshire won the County Championship in 2010. Between 2011 and 2013, he took more than 50 Championship wickets in each of the three seasons and only Monty Panesar and Alan Richardson could point to such consistency.",
            "In all, he took 344 first-class wickets for Notts at 24.18 including 16 five-wicket hauls and three 10-wicket match tallies. Renowned for an all-or-nothing approach to batting -- his 31 sixes in the 2011 season was the highest tally in England in first-class cricket -- he had three first-class centuries to his name.",
            "He ended his eight-year association with Nottinghamshire at the end of the 2014 season, accepting a three-month playing contract at Hampshire as he began an envisaged move into coaching. ",
            "Adams played only first-class matches in England but appeared in 50 and 20-over games during the English close season. He was part of the Auckland Aces side that won New Zealand's domestic one-day cup and Twenty20 tournaments in 2010-11 and represented them in the Champions League T20 in India. The Aces retained their T20 crown in 2011-12.  Adams also appeared in the first Bangladesh Premier League, for eventual semi-finalists, Khulna Royal Bengals."

He holds the highest individual score of 144 in the traditional match against Nalanda made in 1999. The following year was his best, aggregating 940 runs from 12 matches and was selected captain of the Sri Lanka Under-19 side to tour Australia where he won the Man-of-the-Series award with some sterling contributions. Graduating to the Sri Lanka A side, he toured India and hit five half-centuries which saw him being selected for the Sri Lanka team's tour to New Zealand. He was picked for Sri Lanka's tour to Zimbabwe in 2004 but a lack of consistency meant he was dropped after just four ODI appearances. ",
            "He is the first to admit that he did not completely grab the opportunities that came his way. In an attempt to win back his place, he took over the captaincy of Bloomfield in 2004 and thrice scored ninety in the Premier league. In 2005-06, he won the Premier limited overs Man-of-the-Tournament award. The retirement of Russell Arnold after the 2007 World Cup opened up a spot for him but he had to wait more than a year for a recall. He returned to Zimbabwe and scored a crucial 40 in a low-scoring game to set up the victory, and that set in motion an exceptional run of form for Kandamby that saw him break into the Test squad for Sri Lanka's tour of India in late 2009.

            "Zaheer Khan is an Indian fast bowler with all the traits that made the Pakistani fast bowlers a phenomenon. He swings the new ball and reverses the old, he does well on flat subcontinent pitches and relishes the helpful ones away, and he controls all three balls well - SG, Duke and Kookaburra. He might not quite have the skills of Wasim Akram, who he has often been compared to, but mentally Zaheer has become as good as Akram. He knows how to get wickets, he has an intuitive sense of when to go for the kill, and once a batsman has shown him the slightest hint of a weakness, Zaheer preys on it ruthlessly. Unlike the Pakistan fast bowlers of the 2000s, though, he stays away from controversy and is pretty low-key off the field.",
            "Zaheer's career can be easily divided into three distinct sections, neatly segregated by injuries. He was all promise ever since he bowled Steve Waugh with a full delivery in the Champions Trophy in 2000. A mysterious injury in Australia in 2003-04 - hamstring at first and later discovered to be a nerve twitch - then tortured him for the best part of the next two years. Every comeback ended in a frustrating setback through a new injury.",
            "In 2006, though, Zaheer, now with a shorter run up, a fitter body and a meaner mind, dazzled England with 78 wickets for Worcestershire, where team-mates started calling him 'Zippy Zakky'. He was the perfect foil for Sreesanth in South Africa, and he then regained his status as leader of the pack with a match-winning display at Trent Bridge, as India won only their fifth Test on English soil. The new, lethal Zaheer was not only the leader of the Indian attack, he was one of the best in the world. With his guidance, India claimed the No. 1 ranking in Tests and the World Cup in 2011, which he called \"my greatest cricketing moment.\"",
            "Zaheer was seen as a vital resource ahead of a lengthy Test season comprising a four-Test tour of England and then a four-Test tour of Australia in 2011-12. But a hamstring injury on the very first day led to India losing one of their premier match-winners, and also every one of those matches. It wasn't until Zaheer's return for the Johannesburg Test against South Africa that India could stem their run of Test losses overseas. At 35 years, he still had all the tricks but his pace was down and he looked rather spent even while playing the second of back-to-back Tests in Durban.",
            "There was no doubting how much Zaheer prized Test cricket though. He took a five-for in what became his final Test - the same one in which Brendon McCullum hit a triple ton - and ended his career with 311 Test wickets, second only to Kapil Dev among Indian fast bowlers."

            "Chris Read, born in Devon, reared in Bristol and an England A tourist before he had played a first-class game, retired in 2017 as one of county cricket's most respected performers. From an early age, he quickly established himself as the tidiest gloveman in English cricket. But life as a wicketkeeping purist was no longer any guarantee of success by the time his career reached fulfilment and, even more than Jack Russell before him, he soon realised that England honours would not come easily.  He played 15 Tests and 36 ODIs for England between 1999 and 2007 before his career faltered on the rock known as Duncan Fletcher - England's coach at the time felt he was too undemonstrative as a keeper and a batsman overly committed to attack - but many admirers campaigned for his selection long after England had decided to look elsewhere.",
            "Not that Read was a poor batsman - far from it. He averaged 18.94 in Tests, but doubled that in the first-class game. A back-foot fighter with a productive whip-pull, he batted as high as No. 6 in the Nottinghamshire middle order and at one of the more treacherous batting venues in the country, he was often charged with walking out at Trent Bridge to avert a collapse with an individualistic mix of enterprise and batting gumption. It became one of county cricket's great sights.",
            "Nothing encapsulated Read more than the manner of his parting. He had retired from the limited-overs game (Nottinghamshire won both trophies in his absence) but there was still a promotion to win in the final game of the Championship season in 2017. Midway through that game at Hove, disaster threatened. At 56 for 5, with Sussex's first innings of 565 light years away, defeat was looming. Read and Billy Root responded with centuries, the match was drawn and the eulogies could be written without any sense of regret. \"A magical season,\" he said as he reflected on a career that brought more than county records as a wicketkeeper, more than 16,000 first-class runs, just over 7,000 in limited-overs formats and considerable pleasure for all who watched him.",
            "Almost two decades earlier, the emphasis was on England. When Read was picked by England against New Zealand in 1999, he infamously ducked into a Chris Cairns slower ball which he lost above the Lord's sightscreen. He made the one-day team that winter in South Africa and, despite a below-par performance behind the stumps, showed composure with the bat, memorably mowing Shaun Pollock for six to reignite a run-chase.",
            "Read lost ground after his debut, dropping behind rivals such as Paul Nixon, strangely, and then James Foster, initially championed by the England coach at the time, Duncan Fletcher, in the race to become England's next keeper. But he was a more rounded player by the time Alec Stewart finally hung up his gloves in 2003. He duly returned to the top of the pile and, after an immaculate time behind the stumps in the Caribbean, he was controversially dropped in favour of another Fletcher hunch - Geraint Jones, a better batsman, although arguably not by much. Two months later, and Read had been axed from the one-day side as well, despite some combative performances low down the order.",
            "He remained on the fringes of the team and an impressive unbeaten 150 for England A against the Pakistanis in July 2006 finally convinced the management that he was due another chance. A brisk 55 in his comeback Test against Pakistan, in the 3rd Test at Headingley, demonstrated a cricketer with far greater confidence in himself than in his youth. In a Fletcher-inspired see-saw, he was again left out for the 2006-07 Ashes before Jones's loss of form meant he was recalled for the last two Tests.",
            "But Nixon edged him out for the one-day series that followed, and the emergence of Peter Moores as Fletcher's successor and the selection of Matt Prior meant Read slipped gently down the list of keepers. Craig Kieswetter's emergence provided another favoured alternative and put paid to any hopes that Read might be able to add to his 52 England caps.",
            "If England proved unfaithful suitors, he remained a vital part of Nottinghamshire's squad. As he entered his 30s, in spite of taking on the extra demands of captaincy at Trent Bridge, he found a golden run of form that saw him average 42.06 in 2008, and rise to become Nottinghamshire's leading run-scorer by some distance in 2009, with 1203 runs at 75.18, including four hundreds, as the county finished as Division One runners-up. That he had found a mode of batting when England honours were no longer likely became more apparent with every passing season. In 2015, now 37, his average topped 50 and he even headed Notts' batting averages. His England exclusion felt more premature than ever."

            "A left-arm seamer with a fearsome yorker but a chequered injury history, Reece Topley's career was in peril before his 25th birthday as he suffered a series of stress fractures that left him wondering whether he would ever be able to play again.",
            "That four years on Topley is regarded as a vital part of England's white ball plans, as a left-armer who deliveries from a great height, speaks of his mental fortitude. In 2022, he grew in both white ball codes at international level, registering the best ODI figures for an Englishman with 6 for 34 against India at Lord's. A sucker-punch came on the eve of that year's T20 World Cup when he rolled his left ankle, rupturing the ligaments, after stepping on a boundary sponge during a fielding drill ahead of England's final warm-up match. He was subsequently ruled out of the tournament. ",
            "At a skyscraper height of 6ft 7ins, Topley has always towered above his team-mates. An early developer, he first hit the headlines in 2009 when, as a 15-year-old net bowler, his favourite player Kevin Pietersen drilled a drive into the side of his head. He needed stitches but Pietersen left him a signed bat as a more welcome memento.",
            "It wasn't until 2011 that Topley started making his own headlines. As a gangly 17-year-old left-arm seamer with huge potential he took 14 wickets for Essex in his three opening Championship matches - including five-wicket hauls in each of his first two games against Kent and Middlesex. That season was interrupted as Topley had to return to Royal Hospital School in Suffolk to start revising for the summer exams. His father, the former Essex player Don, was his school teacher and cricket mentor so slacking in any department was not an option. ",
            "Topley seemed admirably unaffected by the early hype. At the Under-19 World Cup in Australia in 2012, he stood out as a professional in a boys' game: no one claimed more than his 19 wickets, which came at nine apiece, and Topley relished his status as a senior bowler in England's side. Further recognition - before he had even turned 19 - arrived with an England Lions call-up for the 2013 tour Down Under.",
            "The ECB and Essex have been careful to manage his workload, the county rotating him with their other talented quicks. He was a key member of the team in 2013, taking more than 80 wickets in all formats to earn a place on England's Performance Programme trip to Australia. However, a back injury ruled him out of going to Sri Lanka with the Lions, a reminder of how young fast bowlers need protecting.",
            "Topley had played for Essex representative sides since the age of nine, but immediately after his England debut in a T20I against Australia in 2015 he announced he was on his way, citing a lack of ambition. Instead, he headed for Hampshire, whose success in the limited-overs game was undeniable. He impressed in the white-ball series against Pakistan and South Africa in the 2015-16, and kept his spot for the World T20 in India despite a chastening outing against AB de Villiers in a T20I immediately before it. But he leaked runs in a high-scoring game against the same opposition in the tournament itself, and was left out for the rest of England's run to the final.",
            "But injury struck again, this time in more freakish fashion, in his first season with Hampshire. He failed to bowl a ball after being ruled out for the season during his debut when his left hand was broken when he was hit by a bouncer while batting against Warwickshire's Boyd Rankin. Shoulder surgery followed in the close season and then he suffered another back stress fracture in August 2017 in a season in which he had managed only 112 overs in all competitions. ",
            "Topley signed a white-ball only deal in 2018 and won an England Lions call-up against India A as a show of faith, allowing him to show some neatly-timed form just ahead of the Royal London Cup final, but he was not selected, and soon needed a pin in his back after a fifth stress fracture. He signalled his wish to move on and was released in September.",
            "Sussex took a gamble on him during the 2018-19 winter, allowing him to train and recover at Hove, and he recovered to take 17 wickets in their T20 campaign and play his first Championship games for two years at the end of the season. They were unsurprisingly keen to tie him to a new contract, but were gazumped by Surrey, who became his fourth county when he signed at the end of the season."

On the basis of his school performances he was selected for the Under-19 tour to India in 1997, the Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, and the Sri Lanka A tour to England in 1999. In between, he made his Test debut against New Zealand in 1998-99 but looked all at sea in a disappointing display and did not come into consideration after that. But a match haul of 11 for 126 against England A in March 2005 confirmed his growing confidence and also helped attract the attention of Gloucestershire as they looked for a replacement for Upul Chandana. Bandara, like Chandana, is also a useful lower order batsman. He hasn't been able to nail a permanent place in the one-day set-up but has provided valuable support for Muttiah Muralitharan. It is his all-round versatility which won him a World Cup place for the Caribbean ahead of Chandana. He played just one game and has since struggled to find a place in the line-up. He was, however, named in the probables for the Champions Trophy. "

            "It can be argued that Hamish Marshall has been a talent wasted. A stylish middle-order batsman, he played 13 Tests and 66 ODIs for New Zealand and made three centuries. But turned his back on international cricket in 2007-08 to play county cricket for Gloucestershire and spent 11 seasons in the West Country before returning home to play for Wellington, at 37, the city in which his career had begun. He enjoyed a steady county career without lighting up the English game that his early promise suggested was possible.",
            "The 146 he made against Australia in March 2005 proved the high point in his career, not the beginning of greatness some foresaw. He was unshakable against the pace of the mighty Australians at their peak. Another big hundred followed against Sri Lanka and a year later he was signed by Gloucestershire as their overseas player. The cosy life in county cricket proved too attractive and Marshall rejected a central contract for 2007-08, eventually becoming a home-qualified player for Gloucestershire via an Irish passport.",
            "It was a disappointment for New Zealand, who first picked Marshall in December 2000 for a Test debut against South Africa. Batting at No. 7 he made an unbeaten 40, showing great maturity and promise. But he was not picked again and had to wait for another three years to get his chance when he was called up for the one-day series in Pakistan in 2003-04. In his third game, he scored an impressive 101 not out in Faisalabad, and later scored 64 and 84 to help New Zealand win the corresponding home series. He then helped New Zealand to win the 2003-04 home one-day series against South Africa, and was called up for the 2004 NatWest Series in England, scoring 75 not out and 55 in the group matches before a solid 44 saw New Zealand win the final against West Indies. ",
            "Marshall struggled to hold down a place in New Zealand's ODI side through 2006-07 and although he was not picked in the World Cup squad, he later joined the team as a replacement when Lou Vincent broke his wrist. Marshall played three games in the Caribbean but then sprung a surprise by refusing a national contract.",
            "His career with Gloucestershire began as an overseas player in 2006 where he scored 102 against Worcestershire on début and finished the season with 1218 runs at 60.90. That year he also made his highest score for the county, 168 against Leicestershire at Cheltenham. But since making the move permanent he has failed to match that mark and suffered a torrid 2011 season, making only 401 runs in 19 innings. He bounced back to an extent with his first century for three years in 2012 and managed to average 37.36 in a horrendously wet season. He, like many, found the going far easier in 2013 and made over 1000 runs in a season for just the second time in his career, including four centuries, but slipped back in the following season. ",
            "The arrival of Richard Dawson as coach was good for him, evidenced by his four Championship hundreds in his farewell Championship summer in 2016. He ended 11 seasons emotionally with a pugnacious 70-odd at Bristol, boosting his career tally to 14,286 runs including 30 centuries.",
            "His undoubted highlight in limited-overs cricket was winning the Royal London Cup final against Surrey in 2015, Gloucestershire's first trophy in over a decade. In 2011, along with Kevin O'Brien, he played in the first T20 innings where two players scored centuries; Gloucestershire's 254 for 3 against Middlesex at Uxbridge broke the domestic T20 world record."

            "Kieran Powell is a powerful left-hand opening batsman who began playing cricket when he was eight. Both he and his brother, Alan, have represented the Leewards Islands at the Under-15 and U-19 level while Kieran went on to break into the West Indies' U-19 squad. He played for Nevis in the 2006 Stanford 20/20 and brought his attacking game to the 2008 U-19 World Cup in Malaysia and entertained with his aggressive stroke-play, which brought him 253 runs at a strike-rate of 124. He was part of a depleted West Indies ODI side for the home series against Bangladesh the following year, but was dismissed for a golden duck on debut. In the 2011 season, he was included in the Test squad against India, replacing the out-of-form Ramnaresh Sarwan. Powell continued to be in and out of the national team for two years before a string of poor scores culminated in him being dropped after the Kingston Test against New Zealand in June 2014. In February-March 2015, Powell represented Sri Lanka's Tamil Union Cricket & Athletic Club in Sri Lanka's first-class league. ",
            "In January 2015, Powell issued a statement saying that mixed signals from West Indies cricket authorities had left him \"deflated and confused\" as he attempted to return to international cricket after a self-imposed break for the game. This resulted in his decision to step away from the game for some time. In January 2016, he tried his hand at baseball, without much success. "

            "Fidel Edwards, blessed with one of the most thrilling fast-bowling actions in world cricket, had an extraordinary international beginning. Spotted in the nets by Brian Lara, he was called up for his Test debut after just one match for Barbados, and promptly took five wickets against Sri Lanka in Jamaica in June 2003. He added five in his first overseas Test, and six in his first one-day international. With a round-arm action not unlike Jeff Thomson's, which has left him vulnerable to back strains, he was more of a protégé of his neighbour Corey Collymore than his half-brother Pedro Collins. He bowls fast, can swing the ball and get reverse swing, but insists that he does not go for out-and-out pace. ",
            "Despite regular chances at Test level, however, he rarely showed enough control to be a match-winner and the selectors blew as hot and cold as did his bowling.  They did draft him into the squad to tour England in 2007. He bowled well in the Chester-le-Street Test but was fined for swearing too loudly, and an unproductive series in South Africa followed. He lost his spot for the first Test against Sri Lanka, was recalled in Trinidad and grabbed five wickets to help West Indies draw the series. At one-day level he was given a long run in 2006 but axed towards the end of the year after failing to shine at the Champions Trophy. Edwards was not needed at the World Cup but, on his ODI recall, he blasted through England with 5 for 45 at Lord's.",
            "He reached a personal milestone in the second Test against New Zealand at Napier on West Indies' 2008-09 tour, taking 7 for 87 - his career-best figures - to pass 100 Test dismissals. Settling into the role of senior bowler in the West Indies side, he bowled aggressively without much reward on England's tour of West Indies in early 2009, and was particularly venomous towards Kevin Pietersen and James Anderson. But arguably his most important performances in the series came with the bat, as he and Daren Powell clung on for 60 balls to secure a draw in the third Test in Antigua. Edwards was at it again in the fifth Test in Trinidad, surviving a tense finale to secure the Wisden Trophy for the first time since 2000.",
            "But just as Edwards began to find the consistency that had long eluded him, he picked up another back injury in the course of West Indies' campaign at the World Twenty20 in England in June 2009. He returned to Barbados and was put on a remedial programme, but abandoned it to represent Deccan Chargers in the Champions League later that year. He picked up another injury in the course of that tournament, and was ruled out of West Indies' tour of Australia - perhaps a relief as the depleted side failed to win a single game. The last of his 55 Tests came against Bangladesh in Khulna in 2012.",
            "Hampshire benefited from his presence in 2015. By picking up 45 Championship wickets at 20.8 from eight matches, he was the prime force in their First Division survival, taking 10 wickets in a first-class match for only the second in his career as Hampshire crucially beat Nottinghamshire in the last match to avoid relegation. A broken ankle suffered in a pre-match warm-up at Headingley wrecked his 2016 season as Hampshire only escaped relegation because Durham were demoted after a financial bale-out, but a useful season a year later again helped Hampshire escape on the final day. On his day, he could still be a spectacular sight."

            "Andrew Hall is probably the only cricketer in the world to have been shot at point-blank range during a mugging and lived to tell the tale. Which is all the more remarkable considering that Hall took a bullet in his left hand as a mugger let fly six shots at him at an ATM machine late one night in 1998. Miraculously, the bullet lodged in his hand without causing serious damage and Hall recovered sufficiently to win a place in South Africa's one-day side against the West Indies in Durban in 1999. He was initially thought of solely as a limited-overs specialist and was a regular in the ODI side until 2007, taking part in South Africa's 2003 Cricket World Cup squad and the 2007 Cricket World Cup where he took a maiden five-wicket haul against England in Bridgetown.",
            "For a while, he appeared to have slipped out of the selectors' minds until Australia arrived in April 2003 for three ODIs. With Herschelle Gibbs struggling for form, Hall was given a match as Gary Kirsten's opening partner. Against the world's fastest bowler, Brett Lee, Hall looked the part, scoring a composed 46 and it was enough to win him a place in the South African squad for Sri Lanka. When Gibbs was then out of the picture because of his involvement in the match-fixing scandal, Hall resumed his partnership with Kirsten and against a Sri Lankan attack which included Muttiah Muralitharan on a turning wicket, he made a most impressive 81.",
            "An allrounder who also played indoor cricket for South Africa before breaking into the first-class game, he was not the only talented cricketer in the Hall family, as his father, sister and brother all played for South African representative teams. He was initially seen as a bowler - the livelier side of medium - and batted down the order, but his batting always carried a threat. During the 2003 England tour, he cemented his place with 16 wickets in the series, and ensured South Africa won at Headingley with a buccaneering 99 not out. ",
            "Hall was banned for two Tests in 2003 after he was found guilty of breaching two of the ICC's conduct codes during an ODI in Pakistan. He lost out on a place for South Africa's tour to Sri Lanka in 2004, but fought his way back into the side for a series against India. Given the task of opening the innings in a Test in Kanpur in November 2004, he made the most of the opportunity with 163, his maiden hundred. Kent and Worcestershire were the first English counties to show interest in signing him as an overseas player",
            "He was a part of South Africa's nerve-wracking, unforgettable world record win over Australia at Johannesburg in March 2006. During a Test series against Pakistan in 2007, Hall was a constant source of drive for his team-mates, picked up the vital wickets of Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf at Newlands, and looked almost like Test cricket's version of the Supersub - a player who could come in to do many jobs. He earned a spot in South Africa's 15-man World Cup squad, where he took 14 wickets, but was excluded for the ICC World Twenty20 - a decision which prompted him to retire from international cricket in disgust with 21 Tests and 90 limited-overs matches to his name.",
            "Northamptonshire swooped a couple of weeks later to secure his services as a Kolpak on a three-year deal, and it turned out to be a length and productive association, not ending until his release after a 2014 season which had brought Northants relegation but with Hall one of only two ever-presents in the Championship side, despite finishing the season at the ripe old age of 39.",

            "Inzamam-ul-Haq was a symbiosis of strength and subtlety. Power was no surprise, but sublime touch was remarkable for a man of his bulk. He loathed exercise and often looked a passenger in the field, but with a willow between his palms he was suddenly galvanised. He played shots all round the wicket, was especially strong off his legs, and unleashed ferocious pulls and lofted drives. Imran Khan rated him the best batsman in the world against pace. ",
            "Early on he was vulnerable playing across his front pad or groping outside off stump. He used his feet well to the spinners, although this aggression has been his undoing. Inzi kept a cool head in a crisis and succeeded Javed Miandad as Pakistan's premier batsman, but his hapless running between wickets is legendary and most dangerous for his partners. ",
            "There were no such problems against New Zealand at a boiling Lahore in 2001-02, when Inzamam belted 329, the second-highest Test score by a Pakistani. However, he was then dogged by poor form, scoring just 16 runs in Pakistan's ill-fated World Cup campaign in 2003. He was dropped from the team briefly, but then roared back to form, scoring a magnificent unbeaten 138 and guiding Pakistan to a thrilling one-wicket win against Bangladesh at Multan. He was rewarded with the captaincy of the team, and despite leading them to victory in the Test series in New Zealand, question-marks about his leadership qualities surfaced when Pakistan were beaten in both the Test series and the one-dayers against India. ",
            "The selectors persevered with him and this bore results when he took a team thin on bowling resources to India and drew the Test series with a rousing performance in the final Test, Inzamam's 100th. After scoring a magnificent 184, Inzamam led the team astutely on a tense final day and took Pakistan to victory.  Since that day, Inzamam has gone from strength to strength as captain and premier batsman. By scoring a hundred against West Indies in June 2005, he kept up a remarkable record of match-winning centuries, among the best of modern-day batsmen. ",
            "A magnificent year ended with Inzamam leading his team to triumph over Ashes-winning England; personally the series was arguably his best ever. He never failed to make a fifty, scored twin centuries at Faisalabad for the first time, going past Miandad as Pakistan's leading century-maker and joining him as only the second Pakistani with 8000 Test runs. ",
            "As captain, he never looked more a leader, uniting a young, inexperienced team and turning them, once again, into a force to matter globally. The turn of the year brought contemplation; he missed the Test victory over India at Karachi with a persistent back injury. The subsequent ODI thrashing also raised concerns about Inzamam as ODI captain, none of which were entirely wiped away during ODI and Test wins in Sri Lanka. ",
            "Pakistan were then beaten comprehensively in the Test series in England though all was forgotten - including Inzamam's own poor form - by events at The Oval. There, Inzamam, astonishingly for a man perceived as so insouciant, became the most controversial figure in cricket for a week, leading his side off the field in protest at charges of ball tampering made by umpires Billy Doctrove and Darrell Hair. ",
            "They refused to come out at first, then delayed the start before eventually forfeiting the Test, the first time in the history of the game. In Pakistan, he became a national hero, saviour of a country's pride and honour. He was banned for four ODIs and  returned to lead the side to a series-win over West Indies followed by a disappointing  Test series in South Africa, and then quit the one-day game after Pakistan were eliminated from the World Cup at the first hurdle, an event overshadowed by the death of Bob Woolmer. Even though he expressed his desire to be part of the Test team, Inzamam was not offered a central contract in July and, according to a few, might signal the end of his illustrious international career. ",
            "He, however, made that decision himself after signing up for the Indian Cricket League and faced a life-time ban from PCB. He later quit the ICL and made himself available for selection. The second Test against South Africa in Lahore was his farewell game. He fell just two short of Javed Miandad's record for the highest Test aggregate by a Pakistan batsman and 60 short of a career average of 50.",
            "Inzamam's involvement in cricket following his retirement was limited. He took over as Afghanistan's head coach in October 2015. He began his tenure by helping Afghanistan win their first ODI and T20I series against a Full Member. They beat Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe, beat them again in the return series in the UAE, and also in the World T20 in 2016, which helped Afghanistan quality for the Super 10s. In April 2016, he was appointed Pakistan's chief selector despite having no experience in the role at any level."

He played for Pakistan A against Australia A, before being drafted into Pakistan's squad for the final ODI against Zimbabwe in January 2008.

A brutal bowler with a shoulder-strong action, Tait's body found the workload too tough in the long form and played only three Tests, and was done with first-class cricket by the age of 25. ",
            "In January 2008 he took an indefinite break from the game due to physical and emotional exhaustion and focused on one-dayers and T20s when he returned later that year. As a late addition to Australia's one-day squad in 2010, he unleashed a ball against England at Lord's that registered at 161.1kph, the second-fastest of all-time, but it was the consistent push for speed that crippled him regularly. ",
            "With a muscular and unrefined method that seemed to invite pain, Tait played a significant role in Australia's World Cup triumph in the Caribbean in 2007, where he claimed 23 wickets; only Glenn McGrath took more throughout the tournament. He was back in the West Indies three years later when Australia reached the World T20 final, and was a key component in their pace-heavy but unsuccessful World Cup campaign in the subcontinent in 2011. That looked set to be his international swansong as he retired from ODIs straight afterwards and quit state cricket later that year, but he remained active in the Big Bash League. Five years later, he was back in Australia's T20 team after a surprising recall in the lead-up to the 2016 World T20. But that was the last we saw of Tait on the international circuit: he retired - from all forms of the game - the following March, saying it all came down to his injury issues again. \"The elbow has gone off a cliff now,\" he said."

            "An apparently relentless succession of injuries - particularly injuries to his ankle - threatened to either end his career or turn him into another fast medium seamer who compromised his pace for a longer career in the game.",
            "But Wood was not to be denied. Abandoning a short run-up that was a characteristic of his career up until the latter part of 2018, Wood instead reasoned a longer approach to the crease would put less pressure on his body and allow him to hit the speeds his early career had promised.",
            "The results were dramatic. Returning to the England team for the final Test of the Caribbean tour in early 2019, Wood claimed a maiden five-wicket haul and generated speeds of around 95 mph in a remarkably hostile demonstration of fast bowling. Scyld Berry, the veteran Telegraph correspondent and a man believed to have seen more England Tests than anyone else, rated it the quickest spell he had ever seen by an England bowler.",
            "There was more to come. Recalled to the ODI side just before the World Cup, he went on to play a huge role in the team's eventual success. With Jofra Archer he traded records for the quickest deliveries of the tournament - both exceeded 95 mph - and, by offering pace and wicket-taking potential in the middle-overs, ensured his captain always had a potent weapon in the field. While Archer finished with more wickets (21 to Wood's 18), Wood finished with the better strike-rate. ",
            "Underlining his commitment to the cause, Wood sustained a serious sides strain during the final but, with the match in the balance, continued to bowl at high pace. He was subsequently ruled out of the Ashes series that followed.",
            "Wood never did fit the prototype of a modern England fast bowler. He is skinny, barely 6ft tall and, originally at least, bowled from a sprinter's run-up but after his speed caught the eye with Durham and the Lions, he was given a Test debut at the start of the 2015 summer. He made an instant impression against New Zealand, bowling above 90mph and celebrating wickets with abandon, kept his place for the visit of Australia and capped things off by taking the wicket that sealed England's Ashes victory at Trent Bridge. In no time at all, the imaginary horse that had ridden around the county grounds of England to stave off boredom had become a recognisable part of his England celebration. Here was a fast bowler of unsuppressed vitality.",
            "Like Stephen Harmison, Wood hails from Ashington in Northumberland and played for the same club. The former England quick also encouraged him to go to Australia at 18 to improve his game - not bad advice from a man who suffered bouts of homesickness away from the Northumberland coast. Where Harmison stands 6ft 4in tall, Wood is a level 6ft and delivers a whippier, skiddier ball. In his first five first-class appearances, he took 19 wickets at 21.63, including a match-winning 5 for 78 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in August 2012.",
            "Paul Collingwood's appetite for promoting and encouraging Durham's younger crop of players worked in his favour in 2013. He had a breakthrough summer, claiming 27 first-class wickets at 24.07 to help Durham to the Championship title and confirm his status as the latest in an impressive collection of homegrown pace bowlers. That strong showing was enough to win recognition on the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka, though it lasted only one match before he returned home with a side injury. His 2014 season was further disrupted by the first appearance of a long-running ankle problem but he was again involved with the Lions at the start of 2015 before being called up to the Test squad for the Caribbean.",
            "He did not get a run against West Indies but was capped in the washed-out ODI against Ireland, picking up his first England wicket, and then replaced Chris Jordan in the Test side for a Lord's debut. Wood thought he had taken the wicket of Martin Guptill in his third over, only for replays to show he had overstepped, but he eventually finished with 4 for 140 as England won a thriller. Further limited-overs involvement followed but England were already aware Wood's workload would need careful managing - he played the first two Ashes Tests but missed out at Edgbaston. James Anderson's side strain allowed him to return at Trent Bridge and he took one of the two wickets not claimed by Stuart Broad as Australia were dismissed for 60. Two days later, the imaginary horse got an outing after Wood took the wicket that secured the return of the urn.",
            "He made a blistering comeback from injury in the second half of 2016, delivering some of the most potent fast-bowling spells of the season as he helped Durham's to the final of the NatWest T20 Blast and also featured in England's 4-1 victory over Pakistan in their one-day international series. But further ankle issues ruled him out of a tour to Bangladesh and he missed India, too, after it was discovered that he bowled at the tail end of the English domestic season when his ankle was fractured. It all meant that he faced a third ankle operation within a year and, however optimistic the prognosis, cast doubts upon the resilience of a player who had won a reputation as England's fastest bowler. His comeback in 2017 was then afflicted by heel problems which limited him to five early-season Championship matches, somewhat down on pace, and saw him lose his England central contract at the end of the season.",
            "Lost England contract or not, England could not resist his potential. He sandwiched a disastrous debut in the IPL (conceding 49 in four overs for Chennai Super Kinds and never seen again) in between Tests in Christchurch and against Pakistan at Lord's, where his average pace  of 87mph restated his threat, but his ODI displays were unpredictable and he admitted in Sri Lanka that he was running out of opportunities to claim his place for the 2019 World Cup."

            "A career tends to need to end before the epithet \"legend\" can be appended to it, but in Kent at least Rob Key has already earned it.  After seven years leading the county on the field, for much of the time under trying circumstances, he stood down at the end of the 2012 season, and in the following season proceeded to accumulate over 1,000 runs in County Championship cricket and 500 in the one day game. His captaincy successor James Tredwell then awakened interest from England, leaving Key to take charge once more - 2015 was to be his ninth season at the helm.",
            "Cherry-cheeked Key had been marked down for great things - not least by headline-writers spotting an easy pun a mile off - since he helped England to win the Under-19 World Cup in South Africa early in 1998. His trademark shot was a back-foot biff through the covers, while his off-drive on the front foot pleases the purists too. Never the sleekest, Key's waistline expanded along with his burgeoning batting reputation, and he was 16 stone and counting before Alec Stewart had a quiet word. He encapsulated his approach to fitness on a questionnaire on the Kent website: in answer to the question 'Most likely to?' he responded 'Never run the London marathon'.",
            "Over 1000 runs for Kent in 2001 were followed by a winter under Rod Marsh at the Academy in Adelaide. Key came back even leaner and hungrier, and more runs propelled him past Ian Bell - previously touted as the Next Big Thing - into the England side after Marcus Trescothick's broken thumb and Graham Thorpe's broken marriage created a vacancy or two. A couple of gutsy innings followed in Australia, although he displayed a worrying propensity for getting out when seemingly set, especially just after a break in play. But in 2004, he burst back into the limelight, scoring 1000 first-class runs by the second day of June, and cracking a magnificent 221 against West Indies at Lord's, in his first Test appearance for over a year.",
            "The jury, however, was still out after a hit-and-miss winter in South Africa in 2004-05, when his culpable shot-selection in defeat at Cape Town was offset by an important half-century in the series-clinching victory at Johannesburg. He was appointed Kent's captain for the 2006 season, a role he took on \"to enhance, not hamper\" his career, and as captain of the England A team that took on the Sri Lankan and Pakistani tourists, it was clear he remained in the selectors' thoughts. This was confirmed when he was named in the Academy squad to be based in Perth during the winter's Ashes series, and in 2007 his one-day game, a self-confessed weakness, came to fruition as he led Kent to a memorable Twenty20 Cup triumph at Edgbaston. Come the 2008 season he was champing at the bit for a Test recall, as demonstrated by an unbeaten 178 for Kent against the New Zealand tourists, a performance that earned him the captaincy of the Lions in 2008.",
            "When the selectors did call again it was for England's opening match of the 2009 World Twenty20, at Lord's. Few will remember that Key contributed an unbeaten 10 but many will recall that the hosts lost to Netherlands. It was to be his only appearance, and by the time he decided to give up the Kent captaincy, at the end of the 2012 season, his name had all but disappeared off the international radar. With the county failing to win Championship promotion and their former England batsman struggling to find top form, a change was perhaps best for all concerned, but now he's back at the helm again.",

These fine qualities made him the heart of the South African attack and the soul of the entire team.",
            "Mainstream cricket in South Africa was under pressure to prove itself worthy of attention beyond its hitherto largely white niche when Ntini emerged from the backwaters of the Eastern Cape in 1993. The script was straight out of Hollywood. Ntini was discovered by the then United Cricket Board's (UCB) development programme. His next stop was Dale College, a prestigious school where cricket's roots run deep. Dale was not far from Ntini's home village of Mdingi, but it was a place beyond youngsters of his humble station.",

But his career seemed over, or at best hanging by a thread, when he was convicted of rape in 1999. He protested his innocence vehemently and consistently and, with the support of the UCB, was acquitted on appeal.",

In 2003, he became the first South African to take 10 wickets in a Lord's Test. Five years later he owned the best Test match figures by a South African: Ntini's haul of 13 for 132 against the West Indies under Port-of-Spain's blazing sun and on a not particularly lively Queen's Park Oval pitch was the perfect précis of his career."

Consistent performances on a twin tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya earned him another shot with India A, against South Africa at home, and he took eight wickets in an innings victory in Delhi."

            "A left-arm wristspin bowler with ample variations and a good googly, Tabraiz Shamsi emerged as South Africa were starting to warm to the wave of spinners being produced at domestic levels, although it took a while for him to come through. ",
            "Shamsi bounced between the Highveld and Kwa-Zulu Natal and pushed for a place at franchise level after a strong 2013-14 season for Easterns. He took 47 wickets at 20.02 to finish third in the three-day cup wicket-takers' list, and then played five matches in the 2014-15 franchise 20-over competition where caught the eye of the touring West Indians, who were visiting South Africa that summer. ",
            "In 2015, Shamsi was bought by Caribbean Premier League franchise St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, where Eric Simons was coach. There, Shamsi rose to some prominence, taking 11 wickets at 13.27 in the seven matches he played.",
            "More regular opportunities in franchise cricket came the next season and Shamsi took them. He finished as the leading spinner in South Africa's first-class competition in the 2015-16 summer, in which he took 41 wickets at 19.97 in Titans' title-run. In 2016, he was picked up by the IPL's Royal Challengers Bangalore as a replacement player for the injured Samuel Badree which meant that Shamsi had played in two T20 leagues before picked for the national side. ",
            "His ODI debut finally came in a triangular series in the Caribbean in June 2016. That same year he made his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide and the following June, he played his first T20 international. But Shamsi struggled to find a regular place in the South African side, with Keshav Maharaj established as the Test spinner and Imran Tahir their white-ball specialist. Shamsi was part of the 2019 World Cup squad and played two matches but it was only after Tahir's ODI retirement after the 2019 World Cup that Shamsi came into his own. ",
            "In the 2019-20 summer, he finished second on the Mzansi Super League wicket-charts and was a star performer in the Paarl Rocks' tournament-winning campaign and was afforded a regular run in white-ball series against England and Australia. In addition to his ability to take wickets, he also demonstrated the capacity to hold an end, something South Africa have always wanted from their spinners.\n"

            "Sachin Tendulkar was the most complete batter of his time, the most prolific run-maker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. ",
            "His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to genius batters - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke (though the upright, back-foot punch comes close) it was because he was proficient at so many and could pull them out at will. ",
            "There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off both feet, could temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the world, in all conditions.",
            "Some of his finest performances came against Australia, the dominant team of his era. His century as a 19-year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever to have been played in that country. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the ultimate batter: Don Bradman confided to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself.",
            "Blessed with the keenest of cricket minds, and driven by a loathing for defeat, Tendulkar established his greatness early. He was only 16 when he made his Test debut, and was hit in the face by Waqar Younis in that game, but continued to bat. His first Test hundred, a match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batter to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara as the leading Test run-scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs, 30,000 international runs, and 50 Test hundreds.",
            "He holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs - remarkable, considering he didn't score his first ODI hundred until his 79th match. At just under 37 years of age, he made the first double-century in one-day cricket. In 2012, a month short of his 39th birthday, he became the first player to score 100 international centuries, which, like Bradman's batting average, might be a mark that lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a disappointing 18 months in international cricket. And on November 16, 2013, he retired from Test cricket after a memorable 200th Test, against West Indies. ",
            "Tendulkar's considerable achievements seem greater still when looked at in the light of the burden of expectation he had to bear from his adoring but somewhat unreasonable followers, who were prone to regarding anything less than a hundred in every innings as a failure. He still remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world.\n"

            "Elias Sunny is a typical modern-day cricketer, having more strings to his bow than just one. He is a useful batsman who can bat anywhere in the order, and is a livewire in the field, but his primary suit is his left-arm spin, with which he has taken more than 200 first-class wickets. His strength is his control, and the ability to turn the ball with a round-arm action has often tricked batsmen. Sunny tends to pitch the ball up more than most spinners, and is particularly effective in one-day cricket where he's often topped the averages in the Premier League.",
            "Originally from Chittagong but raised in Dhaka, Sunny has benefited from being a part of Dhaka's club cricket. After impressing enough to win a first-class place in the Dhaka divisional side in 2003-04, he slowly became a dependable name in Dhaka's Premier League as well as being a key performer for Dhaka and Chittagong. Though he usually bats in the lower order, Sunny has opened for Chittagong on many occasions and has also racked up first-class centuries."

            "An industrious allrounder, who is more accurate than quick, and also a valuable lower-order contributor, Ryan McLaren spent several seasons on the fringes of the South African squad before a short, sustained run in the mid-2010s. ",
            "McLaren first came to attention in the 2006-07 summer, when he averaged 43.50 with the bat in South Africa's 45-over domestic competition. With Jacques Kallis holding a monopoly over the allrounder's spot in the national side, McLaren struggled to break through and signed a Kolpak deal with Kent, where he blossomed. He took a hat-trick in the 2007 Twenty20 Cup final to help Kent win the trophy, and South Africa could not ignore him. ",
            "Despite remaining under contract with Kent, McLaren was called up for South Africa's ODI squad to face Kenya and Bangladesh in October 2008, but the county refused to release him. It appeared an international career would not be possible until he was released from his county contract at the end of the 2009 season, making him eligible for selection for South Africa. ",
            "He made both his ODI and T20 debut in November 2009 and his Test debut in January 2010. After he made headlines in May 2010, taking 5 for 19 in the first T20I on South Africa's tour of the Caribbean - the second-best figures in the format at the time - McLaren would have been hopeful of a lengthy international career. ",
            "However, he struggled to hold down a place in the national side until early 2013, when South Africa were forced to look for a replacement for Kallis, who was being rested from bilateral series and asked to sit out the Champions Trophy. McLaren proved an able substitute. In 2013, he played 27 ODIs, notched up his highest score of 71 and took 45 wickets at 23.77. He was South Africa's highest wicket-taker that year and fourth highest overall. ",
            "McLaren kept his place through most of 2014, although his form dipped. He had a poor limited-overs tour to Australia at the end of that year, which cost him a place in the 2015 World Cup squad. By then, he had played 54 ODIs, 12 T20Is and two Tests, and seemed to accept his international career was over. "

Pace is not his calling - he abhors such measurements - but he is unerringly accurate and cuts the ball either way with wicked regularity and glee.

Soon after the second offence, he was caught with a recreational drug in his wallet at Dubai airport and kept in detention for three weeks. Most seriously he was charged in 2010 with spot-fixing - bowling pre-planned, deliberate no-balls - and in February 2011 he was handed a seven-year ban, with two years suspended, by the ICC. With relation to these charges, he was tried at the Southwark Crown Court in London in October, and found guilty of cheating and accepting corrupt payments on November 1. He was sentenced to one year in prison. "

            "The son of Indian parents, but born and brought up in Wellington's eastern suburbs, offspinner Jeetan Patel was fast-tracked into the New Zealand side after John Bracewell, the national coach at the time, identified his promise.",
            "That was no surprise: Patel had taken a five-wicket haul against Auckland on his first-class debut in early 2000 and played a role in Wellington winning the 2000-2001 Championship in the next season. They won again in 2003-04 and were runners up in 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2005-06.",
            "While Patel probably never fulfilled his ability on the international stage, he developed into a highly effective bowling all-rounder at domestic level and has enjoyed a particularly successful spell as a long-term overseas player for Warwickshire, for whom he has produced much of his best cricket. At the end of the 2014 English domestic season - a season in which he had rejected an approach from New Zealand to resurrect his international career - he was named the Most Valuable Player in county cricket.",
            "It was a return of 6 for 32 against Otago in the last State Championship match of 2004-05 that propelled him into international cricket. Bracewell took him to Zimbabwe for a one-day tournament in August 2005. He played nine ODIs during the season, but in eight was either the super-sub or the subbed-out player; his batting - at that stage - offered little. At home his 2 for 23 from ten overs throttled Sri Lanka at Wellington, and won him the man-of-the-match award, then three wickets at Christchurch helped subdue West Indies. All this put Patel in line for a first Test cap, which came against South Africa at Cape Town in April 2006. ",
            "He performed more than respectably - a five-wicket haul against West Indies at Napier in late 2008 was a highlight - but, with Daniel Vettori's presence limiting opportunities, Patel was generally reduced to the role of substitute or second spinner. He played only six home Tests - in each of them he was second spinner to Vettori - and when he finally had a chance to stake a claim as first choice, he struggled against India, Sri Lanka and South Africa. When New Zealand were thrashed by South Africa - they were bowled out for just 45 in Cape Town - with Patel bowled backing away, it seemed his time was up.",
            "But whatever his struggles in international cricket, he proved an inspired choice as overseas player for Warwickshire. After scoring a maiden century on first-class debut for the club in 2009, he returned for every season afterwards except 2010, claiming 185 first-class wickets for the side up to the end of 2014 at an average of just 27.12 and contributing nearly 1,500 runs, too, at an average of nearly 29. He played a huge role in Warwickshire's Championship success of 2012, their T20 success of 2014 and took them within sight of a double of that season with an outstanding spell of bowling against Durham in the final of the Royal London One-Day Cup at Lord's. He finished with 107 wickets in all competitions that year and turned down a recall to the New Zealand squad for the Caribbean tour to ensure he maintained his excellent relationship with Warwickshire. They responded by extending his contract until the end of 2016.",
            "Patel duly paid them back with 69 wickets to top the bowling charts for the season. He subsequently made a comeback to the national side when he was picked for the tour of India in September of that year and filled in for the injured Mark Craig for the second Test at Eden Gardens in his first appearance for his country in over three years."

His stronger suit is his pace bowling, and he returned the best figures by a Zimbabwean on Test debut - 5 for 73 in the first Test against Bangladesh at Bulawayo in April 2001. He also managed a first-ball duck in his maiden Test innings, although as a strokeplaying left-hander, he has a terrific eye for the ball and is also a fine fielder. After growing disenchanted with the game he sat out the 2001-02 season, amid reports of disputes with administrators and fellow players. He pursued a number of lines of employment including, briefly, male modelling. But in August 2002 he announced that he was returning, and in his first game back he took 5 for 79 against Pakistan. He then cemented his place back in the team and put in steady performances during the 2003 World Cup and in England later in the same year.  ",

In June 2004 he joined the growing exodus from Zimbabwe by signing for Tasmania, and also had a brief stint with Durham during the English summer.  But Tasmania released him from his contract early - his spell was dogged by injury - and in February 2005 he returned 'unconditionally' to Zimbabwe.  He was part of the strike against the board later in the year, and spent 2005-06 playing for the Lions in South Africa. He was for a time touted as successor to Tatenda Taibu as captain, but refused to play until he was paid substantial monies owed to him by the board. "

            "Tymal Mills won an England recall for the 2021 T20 World Cup after four-and-a-half years in the international wilderness, during which time regular injuries had threatened his career. Mills, one of the most explosive fast bowlers in English cricket and an innovative thinker about the short-form game, was diagnosed with a congenital back condition in 2015 - his spinal cord and vertebrae are unusually close together and bowling fast too often can agitate his spinal cord - which consigned him to a career as a T20 specialist but he embraced life on the franchise circuit.",
            "Mills only started playing cricket when he was 14 - and it was another two years before it became a serious part of his life - but by the age of 19 had forced his way into the Essex first team, abandoning a journalism cause at the University of East London in the process. He progressed through the academy set-up at Essex and represented England Under-19s and his Championship debut came midway through the 2011 season. By then the National Academy scouts had taken notice and that winter he was fast-tracked on to the Performance Programme, before playing for the Lions on their tour of Bangladesh.",
            "Mills' workload was carefully managed, but he attracted considerable hype: before turning 20, he topped 90mph in front of the Sky TV cameras; then, with Mitchell Johnson terrorising England during the 2013-14 Ashes, there were calls for Mills to be fast-tracked to the Test side to provide similar firepower (he had been used for practise against left-arm bowling in the nets and almost put Graeme Swann out of the tour when her struck him on the arm). A record of six Championship wickets at 66.33 in the 2013 season counted against him and, even though development continued with the Lions in Sri Lanka, he left Essex at the end of another mediocre season in 2014 to join Sussex in the hope that it would galvanise his career so that the statistics began to meet England's hopes. ",
            "Then came the revelation that his future would be in short-form cricket, a diagnosis that he learned to handle with equanimity - even more so when he won an England debut in 2016 against Sri Lanka. Three stand-out performances for England against India led to Royal Challengers Bangalore recruiting him for £1.4m in the 2017 auction and while an injury cut his season short, he became a regular on the global T20 treadmill.",
            "England opted to leave him out of their T20I plans over the next few years. \"Due to his fitness background we probably wouldn't consider him until a World Cup year… we feel like getting a long string of games together and having a set plan could be a better plan than travelling more, maybe playing or not playing,\" Eoin Morgan explained in 2018. But injuries limited his chances to impress and his long-term fitness meant that he struggled to train in between playing appearances.",
            "Things reached a head when he spent the 2020-21 winter wearing a back brace for 12 weeks following another stress fracture, but he starred in the Blast and the Hundred in 2021 by showcasing his skill at the death - batters struggled to pick his slower balls, but could not set themselves for them since he still regularly hit 90mph/145kph, and he defied conventional wisdom by favouring back-of-a-length balls rather than yorkers. Morgan had namechecked him earlier in the summer as a World Cup bolter and Jofra Archer's injury opened up a spot in the squad for him."

            "With a physique and attitude that is reminiscent of a young Javagal Srinath, Ishant Sharma shot into prominence during the 2007-08 Test series in Australia. Standing at 6'4\", his rhythmic, high-arm action allowed him to bowl at around 140 kph. For one who started serious cricket at 14, his rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18. An injury to Munaf Patel provided him an opening during India's tour of Bangladesh in May 2007 but it was in Australia where he caught the attention, prompting Steve Waugh to call him the next best thing in Indian cricket. He showed he could move the ball both ways and his probing spell in the second innings in Perth, where he set-up Ricky Ponting, is the stuff of folklore. He continued to impress in the one-day series, clocking more than 150kph once, and ended as India's highest wicket-taker in the triumphant campaign. ",
            "The glory days continued through his debut season, with a notable performance against South Africa, followed by 15 wickets in four Tests in the succesful home series against Australia in 2008, and a couple of strong shows in Sri Lanka in ODIs. By now Ishant was clearly Zaheer Khan's deputy in the Indian seam arsenal, but things have gone seriously wrong since. Some have blamed it on his being over-bowled, particularly on flat tracks in the IPL, while others point to a malaise that has afflicted all of India's new crop of fast bowlers. The fact remains that Ishant lost the most crucial aspect of his bowling - his pace. Without it, his natural short-of-a-good-length that had tormented batsmen of Ponting's calibre a season earlier lost its venom. Eventually the loss of pace led to a loss of self-confidence. The Indian selectors decided to be careful and began shielding him from the shorter formats of the game in 2009 in the hope that he would rediscover his zip. His struggle continued but given India's limited seam-bowling resources at the time, Ishant was persisted with, even after an ankle surgery in 2012 that put him out of action for months. When he completed 50 Tests in early 2013 he had among the worst averages for bowlers with 50 Test caps to their name.",
            "Since then Ishant has somewhat revived his Test career. He was impressive on the tour of New Zealand, being the top wicket-taker in Tests with 15 wickets that included two five-wicket hauls. On his next overseas assignment, in England, Ishant was the hero of India's famous win at Lord's when he bounced out the England batsmen with his spell of 7 for 74, helping India to a 1-0 lead in the Test series. It was perhaps one of his best performances for India in whites.  "

Short of runs by late 2000, he dropped into the lower middle order. When a loss of form and confidence from Jayasuriya gave Arnold another chance at the top of the order in 2002, he scored 62 and 109 in a valiant rearguard at Old Trafford. Failure in the series that followed left him on the sidelines for long periods after the 2003 World Cup but Arnold made his way back into the team for the home series against Australia. Despite making 51 not out in his last ODI against Zimbabwe, Arnold was dropped from the ODI and Test teams in July 2004. The seven-man Ashantha de Mel selection committee wanted to blood new talent and Arnold's future looked bleak for a while. But he worked hard on his game in the nets and started to score heavily in domestic cricket. Finally, with his replacements failing to impress, he won a recall for the New Zealand tour in December 2004.  However, pressure from the young brigade - the likes of Tillakaratne Dilshan - left him fighting for his place. His Test role went first but, after a poor tour of England in 2006 (following some promising efforts in Australia), he was dumped. But experience can never be discounted in major tournaments and he found a spot in the 2007 World Cup squad. "

Such was the threat to his professional career that just to make a full recovery was cause for celebration. But that did not prevent a certain disillusionment creeping in when he was one of the chief players to suffer from England's 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14. It was an aggrieved Carberry who returned to Hampshire with his international career seemingly spent, even the absence of convincing replacements for the role of Alastair Cook's opening partner not persuading the selectors to take another look. An occasional inexplicable error with the bat and in the field did not advance his case.",

The move did the trick and he made over 1000 first-class runs in a season for first time in 2007, a performance that earned him a call-up to the England Lions tour of India in early 2008 where he scored two hundreds and was also one of three centurions in the Lions' game against New Zealand in May 2008.

            "His reputation in domestic cricket continued to grow, and he scored 1251 runs at 69.50 in 12 County Championship in the 2009 season, with four hundreds - the highlight being a fluent 204 against Warwickshire at the Rose Bowl - until a broken finger ruled him out of the end of the campaign. But it was enough to earn a Test call up and he made his debut in Chittagong in March 2010 in place of the rested Andrew Strauss",
            "His lung illness ruled him out of the England Performance Programme trip to Australia over the winter of 2010-11 just as he gained a foothold in the England side.  It was a long road back. Carberry missed the first three months of the 2011 season but then returned to the Hampshire side with startling effect: he scored an unbeaten 300 during a Championship match against Yorkshire and shared in a third-wicket partnership of 523 with Neil McKenzie - a partnership record at the time for Hampshire. ",
            "Following his illness he was unable to take long-haul flights but he remained on England's radar with the selectors naming him in their Lions side to face the touring West Indies in May 2012. ",
            "In 2013, Carberry enjoyed a strong summer in one-day cricket with over 500 runs in the T20 competition, including a century in the quarter-final win over Lancashire. He was picked for England's ODI in Ireland and retained for the Australia series. He made only one half-century but England picked him to tour Australia and Carberry made his Test comeback. He did not disgrace himself despite England's whitewash but the selectors decide to enter a new era without him and Carberry's international career was effectively ended.",
            "After leaving Australia, he played just once more for his country - in an ODI against Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street the following May. If it was his final appearance in England colours it was an inglorious one - he scored six as England were skittled for 99.",
            "His presence at the top of Hampshire's order remained as strong as ever, though. Even in 2015 when he did not make a first-class century, his consistency put him among the top runmakers in Division One and helped to bind Hampshire's spirit in a season where they escaped relegation on the final day. A dangerous T20 player, he was a vital component in a highly-successful Hampshire side and also played in the Big Bash for Perth Scorchers.",
            "He moved to Leicestershire late in the 2017 season, enticed by a promise of the captaincy which he duly inherited in 2018. But the incoming coach, Paul Nixon, relieved him of the role in late May after a review, describing him as \"slightly more reactive than proactive\" and \"a man of great integrity\" replacing him with Paul Horton. Carberry took paid leave to consider his future as Leicestershire made it clear they wanted him to return as a player and later that season he indicated that he was considering legal action, his time at Leicestershire - and perhaps his entire county career - seemingly at an end.

He is not very tall, but with an action that is mostly front-on, he generates enough pace to beat the bat. During the Bangabandhu T20 Cup in November 2020, Mahmud took eleven wickets for eventual champions Gemcon Khulna, which got him the ODI call-up against West Indies.",

            "Praveen Kumar had everything to become a domestic cricket legend: limited pace but ability to swing the ball both ways, persistence to bowl long spells, and an almost intuitive knowledge of how to take wickets on unresponsive Indian wickets. But he took his limited pace and remarkably smart application of that ability to a higher level. He was India's best bowler during a disastrous Test tour of England in 2011 - his name is on the Lord's honours board - and was remarkably miserly in ODI cricket. Among his best achievements is the match-winning spell he bowled against Australia in the final of the 2007-08 CB Series. ",
            "Praveen is from the western part of Uttar Pradesh, which produces, what he called, \"strong, tough boys.\" He was in his late teens when local coach Sanjay Rastogi pulled him into mainstream club cricket and by the time he was 19, he had graduated to playing first-class cricket. Playing party to his quick rise was his ability to swing the ball, for which he was called \"jaadugar\" [magician] back home in Meerut. ",
            "In the 2005-06 Ranji Trophy, which was his first season and also UP's championship season, Praveen was easily the player of the year: 41 wickets and 386 runs, four five-fors, one ten-for, and three half-centuries. Whenever UP were in trouble, they could turn to Praveen, and sure enough something would happen. His consistency - 90 wickets in his first two first-class seasons - got him into reckoning for the national side. ",
            "Between 2009 and the end of 2010, he was a key element in India's pace battery, with Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra. He could have been a World Cup winner had he not broken down with injury and missed the 2011 tournament. Fitness issues had interfered with his first-class career as well, but he was a regular fixture for UP in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 Ranji seasons and even captained them for four games. Praveen had been part of four IPL teams before he was bought by the new franchise Gujarat Lions in the 2016 auction for INR 3.5 crores. ",
            "Praveen is also known for having a bit of a short fuse. He was suspended from the Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2013 for using foul language against a batsman. He'd used profane language against fans in the heat of the moment too - a notable incident being at the nets in Australia in 2012, although he said he was driven to such extents because \"that guy was going after Rohit [Sharma] non-stop, mother, sister everything.\" Praveen has since grown wiser and tries to avoid the problems that \"do minute ka gussa\" [two minutes of anger] can lead to.\n"

            "After waiting until he was 28 for the opportunity to play international\ncricket, Jeremy Snape could hardly have wished for a more felicitous start\nto his England career. Selected for the short one-day tour of Zimbabwe in\nOctober 2001, Snape played in the first one-day international at Harare. He\nbowled ten tidy overs of off-spin, taking the wickets of the two Flower\nbrothers, and held two catches in the outfield. However, after his final ODI appearance in 2002 he had to wait five years for another call, when his Twenty20 expertise won his place in the World Championship squad to South Africa.",
            "After captaining England Under-18s in Canada in 1991, and touring with England\nU-19s in Pakistan the following winter, Snape began his county career with\nNorthamptonshire, where he played from 1992-98. He joined\nGloucestershire for the 1999 season and became a key element in the team's\ncomprehensive one-day success.",
            "Snape played in each of Gloucestershire's winning sides in four Lord's\nfinals in 1999 and 2000, and was a key member of the team that won the\nunique one-day treble, adding the National League to the cabinet in\n2000. The lack of international recognition for Gloucestershire's local\nheroes raised a few west-country eyebrows at this time, and Snape's\nselection for the Zimbabwe tour was seen in some eyes as a belated one.",
            "Snape's success in Zimbabwe was followed by appearances in the first four\nODIs in the six-match series in India. However he was\nreplaced by Ashley Giles for the last two matches, and did not feature in\nthe five-match series in New Zealand.",
            "Snape parted company with Gloucestershire at the end of the 2002 season\nafter an unhappy period in which he neither saw eye-to-eye with the club's\nmanagement nor commanded a regular place in the county XI. His move to Leicestershire brought a new dimension to his cricket as he became a expert at Twenty20. His loopy bowling and smart batting made him a key part of the team that won the 2004 and 2006 titles. He captained them the second time around, but began to stand aside in Championship cricket to allow youngsters a chance."

That season, he also picked up a hat-trick against Kolkata Knight Riders at Brabourne Stadium.",

However, in the next two years with Mumbai, he managed only one game. His IPL fortunes mirrored those in domestic cricket, where he played in only eight matches in three seasons from 2011-12 onwards and picked up just 16 wickets."

An even more memorable dismissal followed, when Ricky Ponting failed to read his slower ball and pushed back a return catch.  He then made his Test debut against the same opposition, and became only the second Sri Lankan bowler to strike with his very first delivery, when he dismissed Shane Watson. ",

He has since made himself a mainstay in the Test attack, and despite his inexperience, is often called to spearhead the pacemen, when Chanaka Welegedara is absent through injury.",

Hauritz gained an unlikely second chance at international level in 2008-09, but quickly grew into an offspinner who could mix attack and defence successfully. He really showed his value last summer when he took 18 wickets in three Tests against Pakistan batsmen who usually cause severe damage to slow bowlers. ",
            "The haul followed 11 breakthroughs against West Indies and 10 in the opening three Tests of the 2009 Ashes series, when he started strongly but was left out for the final two matches. While a heel injury stopped him from being part of the series against Pakistan in England, he remains a key part of Australia's medium-term plans. During the past two years he also became a regular contributor in the one-day team, although he is less fancied as a Twenty20 operator.",
            "Hauritz surprised himself with his season in 2008-09 as he leapfrogged a host of fringe spinners to finish the season as the only specialist slow bowler with a Cricket Australia contract. It was a stunning turnaround for an offie who was cut loose following his first Test in 2004. Having watched Beau Casson, Jason Krejza, Cameron White and Bryce McGain take preference following Stuart MacGill's retirement in 2008, Hauritz was picked for the second Test against New Zealand in Adelaide despite not playing for New South Wales the previous week. In three matches at home he took nine wickets and appeared in his first ODI for six years, but was kept in the dressing room for the Tests in South Africa. After four breakthroughs in the opening one-dayer against the Proteas, he was chosen in every 50-over contest over two series, leading Australia's wicket-takers in the United Arab Emirates. ",
            "Hauritz, an Australian Under-19 captain, made his ODI debut at 20 and was a surprise selection for the Test tour of India ahead of MacGill in 2004. Hauritz made his debut in the fourth Test, becoming Queensland's first slow-bowling representative since Trevor Hohns in 1989, and picked up Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman after opening the bowling in the second innings. His five match wickets were a distant memory on returning home, where he struggled in first-class games and was dropped towards the end of the 2004-05 season. In the next summer he also received limited opportunities with the Bulls and left for New South Wales. "

            "If a textbook technique was the sole criterion for a first-class opener then Hughes wouldn't have made a rapid rise to the international level. The most important thing as far as Australia's selectors were concerned was that Hughes picked up plenty of runs from his country-baked technique, which included compulsive slicing through point and slashing to cover, as well as stepping away to provide room for tennis-style drives down the ground.",
            "His perceived weakness against the short ball helped him in South Africa in 2009, when he used the pace of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel against them and he was the youngest man to score a century in each innings of a Test when he managed the feat in Durban in his second Test.",
            "But after his stunning rise as the replacement for the retired Matthew Hayden, the fall was swift; after he was roughed up by Andrew Flintoff and failed at Lord's he broke the news of his dropping on Twitter. He remained the Test backup opener and in Wellington in 2010 he finished off the win with a brutal 86 off 75 balls. He replaced the injured Simon Katich for three Tests of the 2010-11 Ashes and despite struggling, he finished the Shield season strongly and was first in line to become Shane Watson's full-time partner when Katich lost his contract. A third Test century arrived in Colombo in 2011 but later that year he could not stop edging Chris Martin of New Zealand and was again dropped.",
            "Returned to the side once more against Sri Lanka in 2012-13, Hughes struggled against spin on the Test tour of India that followed and although he played the first two Ashes Tests in England in 2013, he faced the axe again after a lean Lord's Test.",
            "It had taken nearly four years after his Test debut for Hughes to break into the Australian one-day side, but he showed his limited-overs potential in July 2014  when he became the first Australia to score a double-century in a List A match.",
            "A month later he made the highest score of his first-class career, an unbeaten 243 for Australia A as he staked claim for a Test recall.",
            "There were to be no further additions to his 26 Test caps though as, three months later, he was rushed to hospital after a sickening blow from a short ball during a Shield game. He never regained consciousness and died from his injuries. He was 25."

His international debut came at the age of just 18 and though his youthful promise, backed up by some strong performances for the Under-19 side, was clearly in evidence the elevation came too early as Meth was forced to rise rapidly through the ranks because of Zimbabwe's shortage of options. He suffered as a result and was discarded after the 2006 tour of the Caribbean, remaining on the fringes for a while and spending his winters playing club cricket for Phoenix in Ireland."

            "A composed left-handed batsman with a picture-perfect cover drive and nifty footwork, Jacques Rudolph overcame political obstacles twice to forge an international career that began with a bang but faded against the backdrop of county success. ",
            "Rudolph scored an unbeaten 222 on Test debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong in 2003, two years after he played the unofficial match at Centurion against India, in the aftermath of the Mike Denness affair. His debut came a year after his selection for the New Year's Test in Australia in January 2002 was vetoed by United Cricket Board president Percy Sonn who demanded that Justin Ontong, a player of colour, debut instead. ",
            "When given his chance, Rudolph's response was a statement of strength. His double-century in Chittagong was also part of a record-breaking, unbeaten 429-run stand for the third wicket with Boeta Dippenaar. The partnership was the first 400-plus stand for South Africa in Test cricket. ",
            "Rudolph scored four more centuries, including an unbeaten 102 to save South Africa from defeat in a classic at Perth at the end of 2005, but then managed just one fifty in his next 14 innings and was dropped after a tour to Sri Lanka in 2006. In January 2007, he decided to move to Yorkshire on a three-year Kolpak deal, suspending his international career with South Africa in the hope of redeveloping his game.",
            "He made 1078 runs at 56.73 in his first County Championship season and immediately extended his contract to the end of 2011. In each of the next three seasons he made over 1000 first-class runs and it rekindled his appetite for the highest level. ",
            "He left his Yorkshire deal a year early to re-stake a claim for South Africa with his old franchise, Titans. Rudolph's first season back in South Africa, in 2010-11, was a huge success. He was the leading run-scorer in the SuperSport series, with 954 runs in 17 innings, and was rewarded with a call-up to the national squad to face Australia in late 2011 and partner Graeme Smith at the top of the order. ",
            "Rudolph struggled to carry his domestic form to the international stage and after eight innings was moved down into the middle order. He fared better there, and scored the only century of his second stint, which spanned 13 Tests. He was part of the squad that won the Test mace off England in mid-2012 but was dropped during South Africa's next series in Australia, later that year. "

            "An elegant, technically correct player, Atapattu was a fine exponent of the high-elbow cover-drive. On a lifeless pitch, he was a master of the percentage game, his caution a useful counterpoint to the risks taken by Sanath Jayasuriya, his opening partner almost throughout his Test career. For three years Atapattu was Jayasuriya's understudy before being appointed to lead the one-day side in April 2003; he took over the Test role the following year.",
            "On the surface a quiet and reserved character, his captaincy skills were not entirely obvious to the outsider, but in the dressing room he was a straight-talking, positive captain, firm and fair in his dealings with the players and aggressive in his approach to the game. Under him Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup and ODI and Test series against South Africa at home in 2004, and meted out whitewashes in home Test series against West Indies and Bangladesh the following year. The high point of his tenure was 13 wins in 14 ODIs in 2004. That year, Atapattu made what would be the last of his 11 ODI hundreds, of which nine came away from home.",
            "Atapattu's career was marked by various run-ins with the selectors - most notoriously when he called them \"a set of muppets headed by a joker\" while on the 2007-08 tour of Australia, for which he was a late inclusion following government intervention to bring him into the squad. He scored two half-centuries in that series, including 80 in the second innings in Hobart, but Sri Lanka lost 2-0 and Atapattu announced his retirement from international cricket on the last day of that Hobart match.   ",

He took 28 wickets in the wins in 2019 and 2020, playing nearly all the team's games. The year after, fresh off two T20Is against England, when Mumbai had a middling season, he did just as well, taking 13 wickets and finishing as their second most prolific wicket-taker.",

            "The young Glenn McGrath was described by Mike Whitney as \"thin - but Ambrose-thin, not Bruce Reid-thin\". Later Mike Atherton compared McGrath to Ambrose on a vaster scale. ",
            "Catapulted from the outback of New South Wales into Test cricket to replace Merv Hughes \nin 1993, McGrath became the greatest Australian fast bowler of his time. He went on to beat Courtney Walsh's 519 wickets to become the leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers, and his claim to the title of Australia's greatest fast man is contested only by Dennis Lillee. His obituary was prepared a few times when he needed to take breaks from the game, but he wrote his own farewells. He retired from Tests at the SCG, his home ground, after Australia whitewashed England 5-0 in the 2006-07 Ashes, and was adjudged the Player of the Tournament during Australia's successful World Cup campaign in 2007, his final ODI appearance.",
            "McGrath's USP was an unremitting off-stump line and an immaculate length. He gained off-cut and bounce, specialised in the opposition's biggest wickets - especially Atherton's and Brian Lara's - and he was unafraid to back himself publicly in these key duels. He was a batting rabbit who applied himself intently, which eventually paid off when he made 61, then the third-highest score by a No. 11 in Tests, against New Zealand in 2004-05. ",
            "He rewrote the World Cup record books in 2003 with 7 for 15 against the outclassed Namibians, on his way to adding another winner's medal to a bulging collection. An ankle injury threatened to derail his quest for 500 Test wickets, but after briefly contemplating retirement he bounced back with yet another five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka in Darwin in July 2004. Three months later, in Nagpur, he became the first fast bowler to play 100 matches in the baggy green, and his greatness was further confirmed when he knocked down Pakistan in Perth with 8 for 24, the second-best figures by an Australian. ",
            "Adept at picking his moments, he chose the first day at Lord's in 2005 to reach 500, and his subsequent ankle and arm injuries were crucial to Australia losing that Ashes series. The following summer was also painfully disrupted with the recurrence of his wife Jane's cancer, which called for immediate treatment and McGrath's full attention. He pulled out of the VB Series finals as well as tours to South Africa and Bangladesh, but he made an emphatic comeback that culminated in him taking 26 wickets in the 2007 World Cup, then a tournament record.\n"

The 11 wickets he took against South Africa in Auckland in March 2004, in his first Test for nearly two years, showed that he could bowl New Zealand to victories, but tearing through batting line-ups was not his usual modus operandi and he has often had to bowl long spells à la Ewen Chatfield. ",
            "By the end of the decade Martin was New Zealand's fourth-highest Test wicket-taker of all time but he was equally well known for his comically inept batting. Getting Martin out was as difficult as making a cup of tea and often took less time. No New Zealand player has made more Test ducks than Martin, who did not make a double-figure score until his 36th Test, against Bangladesh. His inability to put bat on ball has cost him the chance to play more one-day and Twenty20 cricket."

            "Tawanda Mupariwa's short, stocky build and pleasant demeanour don't suggest a great quick bowling talent, yet in 2008 he became the fastest Zimbabwe bowler to 50 ODI wickets, getting there in 28 games - nine fewer than Eddo Brandes. But pace isn't Mupariwa's main weapon; a medium pacer who lost a yard after a knee injury in his late 20s, he relies mainly on accuracy, an ability to swing and seam the new ball, and a deceptive slower delivery. Zimbabwe relied upon Mupariwa when their pace-bowling stocks were at an all-time low in the years following the premature retirements of the 'rebel' players, but despite his enviable one-day credentials, he fell out of favour as Zimbabwe searched for genuine express pace bowlers in the lead-up to the return to Test cricket in 2011.",
            "Mupariwa is a product of the Bulawayo development programme. He started off as a wicketkeeper but Wisdom Siziba claimed that position in the local development team and when he joined the Bulawayo Athletic Club the former umpire Chuck Coventry encouraged him to develop his pace bowling. He was selected for the CFX Academy in 2004, and after being controversially omitted from the Zimbabwe Under-19 team Mupariwa's outstanding form as a pace bowler for Matabeleland in the Logan Cup in 2003-04 forced the national selectors to fast-track him into the national squad when the 'rebel' players withdrew from the series against Sri Lanka. He began the 2006 West Indies tour as a fringe player, but made such outstanding progress that he finished as Zimbabwe's first-choice new-ball bowler."

He then struggled against India in a pair of T20Is and slipped down the pecking order as the year wore on. He spent the 2022-23 winter at home, working on his action, then travelled to Zimbabwe to play first-class and T20 cricket for Mashonaland Eagles.",
            "Parkinson became the youngest Lancashire player to take five wickets on debut, in 2016 as a 19-year-old, but it was in white-ball cricket that he grew to prominence. He won an ECB overseas placement with Gordon, the New South Wales club side, for 2016-17, and spent time working with Stuart MacGill while in Australia. ",
            "England Lions recognition soon followed, and he was the leading spinner in both limited-overs competitions in 2018. He took 21 Blast wickets in 2019, sending Lancashire through to the quarter-finals, and while Championship opportunities were limited, he impressed enough to earn an England call-up for the New Zealand series. The tour to South Africa that followed was less successful, where his (lack of) pace came under scrutiny, and he was leapfrogged by Dom Bess in the Test reckoning. ",
            "After an ankle injury sidelined him in 2020, he carried drinks through the subcontinent tour in early 2021. In the first month of the Championship season later in the year, he bowled a ball-of-the-century contender that pitched outside leg and pegged back Adam Rossington's off stump in a match against Northamptonshire."

            "\nA crouching left-hander with a high-batted stance and a grimace reminiscent of Graham Gooch, Ashwell Prince top-scored on Test debut with a gutsy 49 against the mighty Australians in 2001-02. That innings, and a match-winning 48 in the third Test in Durban, seemed to shed his reputation as a one-day flasher. But by the start of the 2002-03 season, his form had fallen away horribly, and he failed in four consecutive home Tests against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.",
            "However, Prince returned to the side following some good domestic performances, and valuable knocks in the middle order against West Indies and England at home. Despite two hundreds in the 2004-05 season - an unbeaten 139 against Zimbabwe in Centurion and 131 in South Africa's 2-0 rout of the West Indies - Prince still wasn't an automatic selection in the longer format of the game. Long rated highly by SA's cricket supremo Ali Bacher, Prince was strong through the off side, and was Western Province's player of the year in 2001. His throwing from the deep was hampered by a long-term shoulder injury, but he remained a brilliant shot-stopping fielder in the covers. The highlight of his career was a fine 119 in the third Test against Australia in Sydney in early 2006, but it was during this series that he became bunny to a legend: Shane Warne dismissed him in the first five innings - though Prince played the rest of the bowlers admirably - and troubled him plentiful when South Africa hosted Australia in March. Scores of 17, 27, 33 and 7 overshadowed a fantastic 93 in the first innings in Johannesburg.",
            "In July 2006 he was named as South Africa's first non-white captain in the absence of the injured Graeme Smith. But after they lost 2-0 to Sri Lanka, Prince made way for Mark Boucher to captain in the tri-series, also featuring India, which was ultimately aborted following South Africa's withdrawal over security concerns. Prince was not included in South Africa's squad for the Champions Trophy, but continued his sterling 2006 Test form against India at home. The highest run-scorer on either side in the three-Test contest, Prince's series highlights included an outstanding 97 in a loss at Johannesburg and a third career hundred in Cape Town.",
            "When Pakistan toured next, Prince was the only centurion in the three-Test series. His 138 laid the foundations for victory in the first Test at Centurion Park, and his numbers can't be argued with, as he ended the season's six Tests averaging 60.67. It was enough to earn him a recall to the one-day side, including a ticket to the West Indies for the World Cup, but it was a disappointing tournament and he was again omitted for the short tour of Ireland. He enjoyed a reasonable summer against West Indies, however, with 263 runs in the three Tests, and began the subsequent tour of England in scintillating form, with a crucial momentum-shifting century at Lord's, and a brilliant match-winning 149 at Headingley.",
            "Just as it seemed Prince's career was heading in exactly the right direction, he was derailed. He broke his thumb ahead of the 2008-9 series against Australia and lost his place to JP Duminy, who won the series with a sterling undefeated 166 in Melbourne. Although Prince was promised his role back, he did not get it and was only recalled for the return series against Australia at home, when an injury ruled Smith out again. ",
            "Prince was asked to captain and open the batting but refused the former if he could not choose his position in the line-up. Jacques Kallis led the side and Prince opened and scored a defiant 150 to announce his return. That was the last of his 11 centuries. ",
            "He was moved back to South Africa's middle order after Duminy lost form and played in 18 more Tests with a top score of 78* and three half-centuries. He was under pressure when South Africa played Sri Lanka in Durban in 2013. Prince was among the low scorers and ran out his partner Hashim Amla. he was dropped for the New Year's Test. ",
            "He continued for his local franchise, Warriors. and for Lancashire. He intended to retire from all cricket in 2014 but stayed on to play one more season with Lancashire, where he remained highly productive, and then retired in September 2015 after being named on South Africa's selection panel. In this final season at the country, he starred in a 500-run stand with fellow South African Alviro Petersen and scored a career-best 261. \n"

Although he bowled tidily throughout, he was generally considered to be out of his depth and was quickly discarded, and seemingly forgotten after two poor ODIs against Zimbabwe that October. He proved them wrong, possessing a resolve and bowling nous that few had recognised.",
            "He left Yorkshire in 2004 and headed to nearby Nottinghamshire, where he impressed in his first two seasons. The first year there he helped them to a double promotion, and the second year he took 50 first-class wickets to become the Player of the Year and help them to the Championship title for the first time in 18 years.",
            "With Duncan Fletcher, England's coach, obsessed by finding bowlers of true pace, Sidebottom was continually overlooked despite having one of the best records in the country. However, six years after his debut - under the new Peter Moores regime - he was surprisingly recalled after a spate of injuries to England's attack. He responded with eight wickets against West Indies at Headingley, still his spiritual home, and developed into a key member of the line-up. He helped England to a 3-0 win over West Indies before bowling without luck against India.",
            "Equally impressive with the white ball he was Man of the Series as England won the one-day tournament in Sri Lanka, but it was during the New Zealand leg of England's winter that he really shone, decimating the hosts with 24 wickets at 17.08, including 7 for 47 in the final Test in Napier.",
            "Further success followed in the home series against New Zealand, during which he was unveiled as England's Player of the Year, but the pressures of carrying England's attack took their toll, and he struggled for fitness thereafter, culminating in an Achilles injury that limited him to a single wicket in an arduous tour of the Caribbean in February 2009. While injuries dented his opportunities in Test cricket thereafter he became an important member of the one-day side. In the 2010 World Twenty20 in the Caribbean his selection ahead of James Anderson raised a few eyebrows, but he proved the doubters wrong as his fiery and disciplined opening bowling was a crucial part of England's triumph.",
            "His England career, though, ended with his international retirement late in 2010, leaving him to play out time on the domestic scene. After helping Nottinghamshire to a last-gasp Championship title that summer, he returned to his Yorkshire roots for the final stage of his career.",
            "Given that Yorkshire were relegated it was not immediately the return he hoped for, although on a personal level 2011 was a highly successful season. His 62 first-class wickets at 22.00, including three five-wicket hauls and a career best 7 for 37 against Somerset at Headingley, were the most he had taken in a single season. He contributed useful runs, too, including two fifties in an aggregate of 389 in the Championship. His 61 against Worcestershire at New Road was a career best. ",
            "He missed a large part of the 2012 promotion season to injury but signed a further contract extension until the end of 2015 towards the end of a summer which saw him lead Yorkshire's Championship bowling records with 49 wickets at 20.30 apiece. He won the Members' Player of the Year award as a result, and hankered after 700 first-class wickets before he took his boots off for the last time. He achieved a landmark achieved by few in spectacular style against Middlesex as Yorkshire completed successive Championship wins, taking four wickets in his first four overs, including a hat-trick, and topping the county averages at 37. Five years on from his international retirement, his longevity was deeply impressive.",
            "As well as leaving his father, Arnie - 596 first-class victims - by now a long way in his slipstream, he also had five Championship titles, adding two with Yorkshire to the three won with Notts. He swung the ball as consistently as any bowler on the county circuit and his accuracy was exemplary. There was life after England after all, just as this salt of Yorkshire earth had always imagined there would be."

This, together with a couple of badly-timed injuries, held his career back. He was chosen to tour Australia in 1997-98, but had to withdraw from the squad after failing a fitness test. In 1998 he made it to England, only to have to return home with an injury early in the tour. He was given a good un in the side in 2000 and 2001 but failed to cement his place with a string of ordinary performances and an economy rate which was too high. He is a genuine No. 11 batsman, but in February 2007, he was named in the South African squad for the World Cup in the Caribbean. (February 2007)"

            "Gareth Batty made a remarkable return to Test cricket after an absence of more than 11 years when England summoned him, at 39, for Test tours of Bangladesh and India late in 2016. After such a long absence his roar of joy in Chattogram when Tamim Iqbal was caught behind was understandable. No English spinner had taken the new ball in the first innings of a Test since John Emburey did so against West Indies in 1988 and his first ball was, in his words, \"a pie\" that was cut for four, but he soon settled and took four wickets in England's victory, only to fall quickly out of favour as England's performances declined.",
            "A feisty competitor, whether as an offspinner or a useful lower-order batsman, Batty's leadership qualities were also a great service to Surrey. He managed seven Tests and 10 ODIs for England in the first, and most substantial, stage of his England career which rarely brought him widespread recognition but added to the respect in which he was held in the game - a respect that was reflected in his surprise return, a somewhat desperate move caused by England's shortage of quality spinners.",
            "Batty initially had to jink around to find a regular first-team spot in county cricket. Born in Bradford, he played for Yorkshire in 1997 before moving south to try his luck with Surrey. The young man then went west to Worcester, for whom he took 56 wickets with his offspin in 2002. That won him a spot at the England Academy in Adelaide in 2002-03, and the selectors sent for him as they cast around for reinforcements during that winter's injury-plagued tour of Australia. Batty played two one-day internationals in Australia, impressing with his tight lines and aggressive fielding, and with that in mind he was included in England's 14-man squad for the 2004 Champions Trophy.",
            "Doubts persisted about whether he turned it enough to trouble Test batsmen, but he was nevertheless selected for England's trip to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in 2003. It was an eventful tour - he came close to drowning in a surfing accident in Galle, and at times struggled to keep his head above water with the ball. His batting against Muttiah Muralitharan, on the other hand, was a revelation, and he was instrumental in saving back-to-back Tests at Galle and Kandy. However, his chances thereafter were limited to the occasional stand-in role, most notably during the Test in Antigua when Brian Lara reached 400.",
            "Despite consistent seasons for Worcestershire he was overtaken by other spinners, but was briefly recalled to the one-day squad to face West Indies in 2009. Not content with the ambition shown at Worcestershire he made himself available to switch counties in the 2009 summer and was snapped up on a sizeable deal by Surrey - a move that led to him being heckled by the crowd on his return to New Road.",
            "In 2011, he played an important role part in bringing the CB40 trophy to south London, taking 13 wickets at 23.15. However, the next two years amounted to picking up the pieces. Batty assumed the captaincy when Rory Hamilton Brown took time away from the role and the game after Tom Maynard's tragic death, leading a shell-shocked dressing room with considerable dignity and helping them avoid relegation in 2012.",
            "He was unable to repeat the trick the following year when he had to step back into the captaincy void, this time left by Graeme Smith after he succumbed to a chronic ankle injury, which ruled him out for most of the season. Surrey finished bottom of Division One, winning only one game. Their run to Finals Day was more memorable, though Batty's participation in the competition was ended by an unsavoury altercation with Peter Trego in Surrey's quarter-final against Somerset at The Oval. The ECB found him guilty of two Level Two breaches of conduct and he was subsequently banned for two games, missing the semi-final and final. Age had not dimmed Batty's competitive spirit and, in 2014, he suggested that he was bowling better than ever and could still perform a role for England. He took career best figures of 8 for 68 in his first game of the season, after an injury-ruined start, and ended with 39 wickets at 23.46 apiece. In a young side, his experience was also of great value. His no-holds-barred appealing, and passionate celebrations if a decision was given in his favour, became part of the Kennington soundtrack."

In 2007-08, he declared Boyce \"the best spinner in Australia not in first-class cricket\". Then, in 2011-12, Mallett said Boyce was \"the best leggie I've seen in first-class cricket since Warne\". It was high praise indeed. One of the greatest challenges Boyce has faced, though, has been the lack of spinning pitches in his home state. It has not been unusual for Boyce to go through the first innings of a match without bowling a ball, and in some cases nearly an entire Sheffield Shield game. Still, when the conditions have been more favourable, he has shown his value: he picked up 26 Shield wickets in 2013-14 after Cricket Australia issued instructions for states to prepare surfaces that would provide a more even contest. That brought an Australia A call-up for the four-day games against India A in Darwin in 2014, and he also played in the one-day quadrangular series. It was Boyce's second Australia A call-up, after he played against the England Lions in a one-day series in February 2013."

Brown's skilfully disguised offcutters and knuckleballs made him a priceless asset at the death, and he cemented his reputation with a solid 2019 Blast season, holding his nerve in a one-run semi-final win against Nottinghamshire.",

            "He was offered a Cricket Scholarship at the University of Worcester and made his Championship debut during the 2017 season as an 18-year-old. He would have played in at least two franchise leagues in the 2018-19 winter but for a stress fracture, but instead completed his business management degree on his way back to full fitness. ",
            "Brown earned a maiden England call-up for the T20 series in New Zealand in 2019-20, performing creditably on some small grounds, but failed to play a game in his planned Big Bash stint for Melbourne Stars due to another back injury, which also ruled him out of the South Africa tour. His 2020 summer was a setback: he took only eight Blast wickets with an economy rate of 10.85, struggling for confidence after his fitness issues."

            "One of many South Africans who has followed the well-trodden path into county cricket, Neil Carter's story is an encouraging tale of enthusiasm and determination defying logic and pragmatism. Told he was no longer required by Warwickshire in September 2004, six years later he found himself leading the county's attack and forging a reputation as one of the most useful allround cricketers on the circuit. ",
            "After the initial loss of his contract in 2004, rather underlining the sense that Carter has not always been as appreciated as he might be, Warwickshire released him again at the end of 2007. They reasoned that his best days were behind him and that he would struggle to maintain form and fitness. But he  fought his way from the brink of cricketing oblivion to reinvent himself as a skillful bowler and highly-effective batsman and, having passed 100 first-class appearances and approaching 300 wickets, it's not looking like such a bad career move. ",
            "Now, in his mid-30s, he is bowling better than ever and key to his improvement is his recently acquired ability to swing the ball. After starting his career as a tearaway fast bowler, he is now a model of discipline. He is also capable of destructive batting, and is often used at the top of the order in one-day cricket.",
            "Carter's best season came in 2010 when he picked up 51 first-class wickets at 22.13 - his efforts went a long way to saving Warwickshire from relegation, from which they built a platform to narrowly miss out on the title in 2011 and run away with it in 2012. But Carter played only bit parts in both campaigns as injury began to take it's toll. A pelvic problem ruined his 2011 season and in 2012, Chris Woakes was preferred in the allrounder's slot.",
            "As a result of his wearing body and playing time becoming more marginalised, Carter decided to retire from county cricket at the end of 2012. He very nearly went out in fairytale fashion in the CB40 final at Lord's. He came into bat for the last ball of the match, needing one to win, but swung and missed as the match was tied and Warwickshire lost to Hampshire having lost more wickets."

Langeveldt first came to prominence with his ability to swing the ball at genuine pace, and further work on his action in recent seasons allowed him to generate even more movement, bringing him to the attention of the national selectors. He made his one-day international debut against Kenya in Kimberley in 2001-02, taking two top-order wickets. He followed that with career-best figures of 4 for 21 when the two sides met for a second time at Newlands shortly afterwards. Langeveldt was included in South Africa's 15-man squad for their ill-starred World Cup campaign in 2003, playing only in the pool match against Kenya. He returned to favour when South Africa experienced a dramatic slump in the middle of 2004, taking 3 for 31 in Sri Lanka and then, in perhaps his most impressive spell so far, 3 for 17 against Bangladesh in the ICC Champions Trophy.

            "An offspinner whose work as a curator took him from Canberra to Adelaide, Nathan Lyon completed a remarkable rise when he was picked in Australia's Test squad in July 2011. The previous year, he had taken up a job on the Adelaide Oval groundstaff, and his bowling talent was spotted by the South Australia's Big Bash coach Darren Berry. Lyon impressed in T20s for South Australia, made his first-class debut, and within seven months was a Test cricketer. ",
            "A classical offspinner who flights the ball and looks for wickets, Lyon struck with his first delivery in Test cricket when he had Kumar Sangakkara caught at slip in Galle. It was part of a haul of 5 for 34 and the beginning of a career that would end Australia's cycle of churning through Test spinners in the post-Warne era. By 2015, Lyon had become Australia's most successful Test offspinner of all time, passing Hugh Trumble's tally of 141 wickets, and he was affectionately nicknamed by his teammates as the GOAT - greatest of all time - as a result. Many more milestones followed. In 2023, against Pakistan in Perth, he joined the rare air of the 500 club.",
            "However, Lyon's career was not without bumps along the way. In 2013 he was dropped from the Test team twice, first in India after he was attacked by MS Dhoni in the first Test in Chennai, and then for the first two Tests of the Ashes tour of England. The Ashes axing was especially galling for Lyon, given that he had taken nine wickets in his previous Test, the fourth and final Test of the Indian tour in Delhi, and he was overlooked for the uncapped teenager Ashton Agar. By the third Test, Lyon was rightfully back in the side and continued to be a consistent performer. He did not miss another Test until being injured in the 2023 Ashes at Lord's, having brought up 100 consecutive appearances.",
            "In late 2021, against England at the Gabba, he came just the third Australia to take 400 Test wickets leaving only Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne ahead of him. It was a more fitting moment than the 300th wicket three years earlier against South Africa at Newlands which was largely missed in the aftermath of the ball-tampering scandal. He has claimed two eight wickets in India: a career-best 8 for 15 in Bengaluru in 2017 and 8 for 64 in Indore in 2023."

The lack of opportunities in his home town forced him to quit playing cricket and seek full-time employment to support his family. He was working in a plastic pipe factory and playing club cricket before Aaqib Javed had summoned him to the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. Aaqib was enthused by what he saw and soon after, he was playing first-class cricket for Khan Research Laboratories. He took nine wickets in his second game and ended the season with an impressive 43 wickets in ten games. He came close to national selection when he was named as a replacement for one of the injured seamers for the 2010 World Twenty20, but his name was withdrawn."

In November 2011, he joined Hampshire on a developmental contract and the MCC Young Cricketers programme at Lord's.",

A Championship debut, in which he began with a duck, followed against Leicestershire. He returned to Hampshire's Championship side in September 2013 and impressed with two half-centuries. Despite limited opportunities, Hampshire offered him a contract until the end of the 2016 season."

            "At U-19 level Junaid Khan was among of a crop of the most promising young fast bowlers in recent years, alongside Mohammad Amir. Good pace and better stamina and an ability to move the ball around if the conditions are right, Khan finally made it to national contention when he was called up for Pakistan's 2011 World Cup squad as a late replacement for Sohail Tanvir. His Test debut, against Zimbabwe in 2011, was uneventful, but in his second Test he showed his class with a five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka on a flat surface in Abu Dhabi. ",
            "Next year he was even more impressive in both Tests and ODIs, as he enhanced his reputation as an extremely skillful swing and seam bowler, who was also pacy and accurate. In three Tests in Sri Lanka, he took 14 wickets at 21.78, twice taking five-fors and achieving an outstanding strike rate of 43 balls per wicket. In the three-match ODI series in India, he troubled all the top Indian batsmen, taking eight wickets at an economy rate of 3.66."

            "A swing bowler who learned to weave outswingers on Gabba greentops, Michael Kasprowicz matured into a subcontinental specialist with reverse swing, heavy cut, and a this-isn't-too-hot-for-another-over attitude. He bravely carried an injury-hit attack beset by Navjot Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar in 1997-98, popped back in 2001, and returned in 2004 to help Australia conquer their final frontier, India. In between whiles, he took 7 for 36 at The Oval in the 1997 Test where Australia famously crumbled to 104 all out chasing 124; and seven in a match twice in Perth, in maulings of Pakistan five years apart from each other.",
            "To call Kasprowicz a workhorse would be unflattering, though the description fit his stamina and size - he was an Australian Schoolboys rugby forward. Regularly clocked faster than his new-ball counterparts (excluding Brett Lee), Kasprowicz caused headaches for left-handers with his angle and dart-perfect line, much like Paul Reiffel, another underrated third wheel. ",
            "After three years mostly spent refining his efficient yet aggressive action with Queensland and Glamorgan, in 2004 Kasprowicz marked his fifth recall with 13 matches, his longest Test run. During that wildly successful year he, Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie were so sharp that Lee ran their refreshments. Only four times in 2004 did he leave an innings without a wicket, collecting 47 victims.",
            "Kasprowicz missed most of 2006-07, back and groin problems limiting him to a season of eight deliveries for his state, and he lost his Cricket Australia deal. Still, he had done enough to retire as the second-highest Sheffield Shield wicket-taker of all time, with 441 dismissals, behind only Clarrie Grimmett, and Queensland's highest.",
            "Kasprowicz waited five months and three Tests for his first wicket, but his greatest miss came during the 2005 Ashes, when his courageous 59-run partnership with Lee at Edgbaston ended three short of victory. Returning from that tour on the outer, he responded with 44 Pura Cup wickets and was recalled for the trip to South Africa, where he and Lee reversed their Birmingham nightmare with a 19-run stand that earned a nail-biting two-wicket victory. It was the final act of an eventful and satisfying Test career. "

            "When news broke out that Nazmul Hossain will play against Pakistan in a Test match starting December 17, 2011, in what would be the second Test of his career, exactly seven years after his debut, one journalist asked what he might do if he had to play his third Test after an equivalent break. \"If I play my third Test after seven years then my career is over,\" he said, smiling.",
            "Nazmul has always been there and thereabouts, considered a one-day specialist mainly for his ability to contain batsmen, a skill that has also been construed as an inability to pick up wickets in the longer format. His ill luck too has played a part, with injuries hitting him at crucial moments just before various team selections.",
            "His best moments have been in one-day cricket, with three performances standing out - two of them resulted in Bangladesh wins while one was memorable for the drama. In a tri-nation final in January 2009, Nazmul removed Upul Tharanga, Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Thushara to pin Sri Lanka to 6 for 5. Bangladesh lost this game but Nazmul's crucial final over in the first ODI in the 4-0 series win over New Zealand the next year again proved decisive. Unfortunately for him, however, his brilliant last over ended badly after he damaged a finger while attempting a return catch. In the 2012 Asia Cup game against Sri Lanka, Nazmul's three wickets - Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillekaratne Dilshan - never gave Sri Lanka a chance to post a big score. Bangladesh won and made it to the final for the first time ever."

            "In a land where fast bowling talent has been dwindling alarmingly over the last decade, Kemar Roach is perhaps the brightest hope. At well under six feet, he doesn't have the height of some of the earlier West Indian greats, but he has extreme pace, consistently touching the late 140s (kph), and can skid on to batsmen quicker than they realise.",
            "Roach burst into international cricket with 13 wickets in his first two Tests, against Bangladesh, but made his name on the tour of Australia in 2009-10. Consistently bowling at around 150kph, he hurried most of the Australian batsmen and made the headlines in the Perth Test, forcing Ricky Ponting to retire hurt after hitting him on the elbow with a pacy 146kph delivery. In the 2010 IPL auction, he was bought by Deccan Chargers for a healthy sum of $720,000, but it's in the longer format that he holds the greatest promise, a fact that was confirmed by his ten-wicket haul in two Tests in Sri Lanka in 2010-11. He picked up his maiden ten-wicket haul in Tests in 2012 against Australia in Trinidad.",
            "By the end of 2014, Roach seemed set to fulfill his promise, with a bowling average in the mid-20s and a strike rate below 50 after 29 Tests. An ankle injury suffered during the Centurion Test in December 2014, however, slowed him down - in both senses of the term. Significantly down on pace after his recovery and return, he took just nine wickets in eight Tests that included a tour of England, and home and away series against Australia. He was left out ahead of the 2016 home Tests against India. Having to prove himself all over again in domestic cricket, Roach took 23 wickets at 16.17 in the 2016-17 Professional Cricket League, and was back in West Indies' Test squad for their 2017 tour of England."

In his debut season Mohit had played just three matches when Haryana made an impressive run to the semi-finals, but during the 2012-13 Ranji season he emerged as one of the best fast bowlers in the country, finishing as the fifth-highest wicket-taker. Despite that, not many had seen or known about the youngster from Faridabad, who had been on the fringes ever since he rose through age-group cricket camps organised by the Haryana Cricket Association. ",
            "But during the 2013 IPL, Mohit's talent was unveiled as MS Dhoni picked him consistently in the Chennai Super Kings XI. Not only that, he also gave him the new ball and Mohit responded handsomely. Standing at about 5'11\", Mohit has a smooth delivery stride, and though he is still working on his final landing movements with experts like Andy Bichel, he can consistently bowl at about 135 kph. Accuracy is his strongest suit, as he bowls a tight line and length regardless of the batsmen, pitch or ground conditions. In the IPL, his ability to bowl consistently in the channel around off stump stood out more than anything else. That allowed him to be one of the best Powerplay bowlers in the tournament. "

After making a nervous debut as a 20-year-old on the 1996-97 Pakistan tour, he spent seven years as a fringe player, performing steadily but never quite making the most of his opportunities. He was overlooked for the 2003 World Cup and then failed to make an impact in the NatWest Series in England. He did however make the squad for the 2003-04 tour to Australia. Brent then allied himself with the 15 rebel players whose dispute with the Zimbabwe board lead to their dismissal in 2004, and it seemed that this had brought his international career to an end."

His parting gift to Northants was his best innings and match figures in first-class cricket - 6 for 79 and 9 for 95 respectively - against Kent at Canterbury. He then returned north to Old Trafford where he had once worked as a community coach and wondered if he would ever make the grade.",

            "After deciding cricket was his sport having juggled it with a promising junior tennis career, he got his first extended run in the Sydney Thunder side during their victorious 2015-16 Big Bash campaign, and quickly became one of the competition's most consistent performers with the ball.",
            "Having impressed in front of him in the BBL, Green formed something of a partnership with Johan Botha, who signed him while coach of Guyana Amazon Warriors in the Caribbean Premier League as a replacement player. Green quickly repaid his faith, even taking over as captain for the last few games of the 2018 tournament as Guyana lost in the final, and Botha not only re-signed him in the Caribbean, but also picked him up for Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League.",
            "A useful lower-order batsman and a superb outfielder, Green's opportunities have remained limited in other formats of the game, but he is recognised as a talented short-form player. He was picked up by Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL auction in late 2019, and continued to globe-trot on the franchise circuit, while signing a record-breaking six-year deal with the Thunder.",
            "Green suffered a major setback in early 2020, when he was banned from bowling due to a suspect action, with his offbreak and his quicker ball both coming under scrutiny. He was cleared six months later following testing in Brisbane."

            "There could hardly be a more appropriate nickname in Australian cricket than Rhino. Whether an adaptation of his first name or a comparison to the stampeding animal, it fits Ryan Harris perfectly. A hulking fast bowler who charges in and tramples the hopes of opposition batsmen, Harris delivers wickets in bulk. The only problem for Australia is a long and varied list of injuries that have kept Harris from playing anywhere near the amount of Test cricket they would have liked. He was also a late entrant to international cricket, debuting at the age of 29. For the first half of his career, Harris was little more than a journeyman medium-pacer with South Australia. A significant boost in pace came from increased strength and fitness, and by the time he moved to Queensland in 2008 - via a mistaken signing with Sussex on a British passport - he was a genuine fast bowler. His first season with the Bulls brought 33 victims at 26.48 and Australian honours weren't far away.",
            "His debut Test series in New Zealand in 2010 brought nine wickets and later that year he claimed nine in the Perth Ashes Test, but in the following match his intensive method of exploding through the crease led to a broken bone in his left ankle that required surgery and ruled him out for half a year. Harris already had a chronic knee injury that will be with him until he retires, but when fit he is invaluable. A hamstring injury ruled him out of the last Test in Sri Lanka in 2011, but already his five-for had helped deliver victory in Galle and his late movement helped make him Australia's leading wicket taker. He flew home from the South African tour later that year with a hip injury that caused him to miss five Tests, and on the West Indies tour in 2012 he was controversially rested for the middle Test of a three-match series. Shoulder surgery in the 2012 winter meant he missed the whole 2012-13 international summer, but a return late in the Sheffield Shield season was encouraging. Despite picking up an Achilles tendon injury in the IPL, he was able to play in the 2013 Ashes in England."

            "The journey took a little longer than expected, but Ben Hilfenhaus picked up a baggy green in 2008-09 to re-confirm his status as one of Australia's bowling stars. While back and knee injuries have worn him down at times, he pushed through the problems to join Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle in a bowling attack that could become frightening if the trio stays together. Hilfenhaus swings the ball at speed and gained seven South African wickets in the three games before going home to rest his back ahead of the Ashes tour. ",
            "He starred in England, leading the series wicket-list with 22, and gained approving nods from the local seam bowlers with his combination of movement in the air and off the wicket. After being Man of the Match in his first home Test in 2009-10, he missed the rest of the summer with knee tendonitis that took more than six months to ease. Back in England for the Pakistan series, his eight wickets in the two games were no surprise, but his 56 not out at Lord's was.",
            "Hilfenhaus was able to lay down his trowel after a series of dramatic performances in his first two seasons catapulted him to a national contract in 2007. Two years earlier, Hilfenhaus was earning money on a building site, but his ability to shape the ball away at 140kph earned a six-figure pay packet. \"It has been a fast ride,\" he said after picking up the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year prize in February 2007. A month earlier he represented Australia for the first time in a one-day international on his home ground at Hobart, taking only 12 balls to get his maiden wicket when he trapped Brendon McCullum. ",
            "A strong and fit man from Ulverstone in northern Tasmania, Hilfenhaus is only the second fast bowler from the state to play for Australia after Greg Campbell, Ricky Ponting's uncle. While shaping the ball away is his specialty, he can also angle it in and his repertoire was crucial to the Tigers' maiden Pura Cup victory in 2006-07. Hilfenhaus' 60 wickets at 25.38, the third most in the competition's history, included three five-wicket hauls, but his back-breaking workload means he is always an injury candidate. He delivered 509.1 overs in the first-class arena that summer, nearly 200 more than any of his domestic fast-bowling counterparts. His collection of 28 wickets at 43.82 in 2007-08 was not the follow-up campaign he wanted but the selectors showed faith and chose him in Australia's Test squad to visit the West Indies in 2008, although he was later ruled out due to a recurrence of stress fractures in his back.

After some opportunities at junior levels, Ireland decided to improve his game in club cricket in England, and after a player rebellion of 2004 was given more opportunities to perform in Logan Cup cricket, and was included in the national team squad the following year. He struggled on his first tour, to West Indies, breaking his left hand in practice at the start of the programme. When he recovered, he struggled with his length and tended to bowl too short, which proved fatal against batsmen as adept with the pull as most West Indians. He secured a more regular place at the end of 2006 and was included in Zimbabwe's World Cup squad, although he made only one appearance. ",
            "To the chagrin of many in Zimbabwe cricket circles, he retired from international cricket on the team's return home, complaining about the country's cricketing administration, and soon after signed a two-year deal with Gloucestershire under the Kolpak agreement. While he enjoyed moderate success with the county, it surprised many when he returned to play in Zimbabwe's revamped domestic Twenty20 competition in February 2010. It remains to be seen whether a comeback to the national side is a possibility, but his county career took him to Middlesex, back to Gloucestershire and on to Leicestershire, with the latter releasing him at the end of the 2014 season.

However, a serious knee injury forced him home and reconstructive surgery kept him out of the entire 2007 season. He returned during the 2008 summer with some impressive results, and was named in the Performance Squad to tour India. He was added to the ODI squad before the Mumbai terror attacks brought the series to an early finish, but further elevation followed when he was called into the full squad for the two Test series, making his debut in the final Test in the Caribbean.",

Khan was overtaken by other pace contenders thereafter and when Kent couldn't afford to keep him he moved to Sussex ahead of the 2011 season. There he remained hostile at his best but without the consistency to push for another international call-up."

            "Marnus Labuschagne's ascent to the higher echelons of Test batting was an extraordinary tale of making the most of an unexpected opportunity. During the Lord's Ashes Test against England in August 2019, Steven Smith was felled by Jofra Archer's bouncer and Labuschagne would become his concussion substitute - the first time in Test history the protocol had been used. By the end of the year he had eclipsed Smith as the leading Test run-scorer in the world, and locked in the No. 3 spot, in the midst of a prolific home summer that brought him four centuries in five matches against Pakistan and New Zealand including a double century at the SCG.",
            "It was a far cry from a year previously when he had been the shock choice to bat No. 3 against India in Sydney, in just his third Test and with a first-class average in the low 30s, having been a surprise call-up to the 2018 tour of UAE to face Pakistan as Australia began to rebuild following the ball-tampering crisis. ",
            "Labuschagne was born in Klerksdorp, in South Africa's North West province, to South African parents. His family emigrated to Australia in 2004 when he was 10. He grew up speaking Afrikaans, and only became fluent in English after moving to Australia. Before his international call-up he had been best known for his work as a substitute short leg fielder for Australia taking a superb catch off Nathan Lyon in the 2014 Brisbane Test against India. He made 83 on his Sheffield Shield debut for Queensland in 2014 and was the second leading run-scorer in the 2017-18 Sheffield Shield season scoring 795 runs at 39.75 with two centuries. ",
            "In his first two Test against Pakistan it was his useful legspin that stood out as much as his batting as he took eight wickets while showing a glimmer of his potential with the bat in Abu Dhabi. Following the recall against India, he made a composed 81 in the pink-ball Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane.",
            "What came next was a key part of his story as he signed for Glamorgan for the first part of the 2019 county season where he would churn out 1114 runs in 10 matches, honing his technique against the moving Duke ball and then winning the race for a spot in the Ashes squad.He largely maintained his prolific 2019-2020 form over the the following seasons with another double century against West Indies in Perth taking his average back above 60 although relatively leaner returns in 2023 brought that down."

In a blazing spell where he seamed and swung the ball prodigiously, Usman picked up five wickets for nine runs in 3.1 overs.",

However, in 2017, he turned back the clock in just his second ODI, scything through the Sri Lankan top order in Sharjah, requiring just 21 balls to complete a five-for and helping skittle them out for 103."

Making his first-class debut in 2004-05, he quickly established himself by taking more than 20 wickets in each of his first three first-class seasons. Vinay soon added the inswinger to his repertoire, and his consistency earned him an IPL contract with Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008. His first defining domestic season was in 2009-10, where he captured 46 wickets, besides mentoring his fast-bowling colleagues, Abhimanyu Mithun and S Aravind, to lead Karnataka to the Ranji Trophy final for the first time in 11 years.  Some good performances in IPL 2010 earned him a spot in India's squad for the World T20 in West Indies, but he has not been able to hold it down consistently. His most recent international appearance came in 2013.  "

When he came to Colombo he was selected as one of 15 probables by Daryl Foster, the Australian fast bowling coach, for the Sri Lanka Pace Academy headed by former Sri Lanka fast bowler Rumesh Ratnayake in 2000. Soon afterwards he was sent to the MRF Pace Academy in Chennai to further develop his skills. Playing for Moors SC since 2002 he bowled his club to the Premier league title in 2002-03 capturing 34 wickets (avg. 24.14) in 13 matches. But his career-best performance came the following season when he took a match haul of nine wickets against Colombo Cricket Club to steer Moors to a comprehensive ten-wicket win. He took the majority of his wickets bowling inswing and trapping the batsmen leg before. Welegedera toured Sharjah with the Sri Lanka Academy side and took seven wickets against UAE, which earned him selection for Sri Lanka A. But he suffered an ankle injury and had to be operated in Australia. The injury kept him out of cricket for 1 ½ years, but his Test debut finally arrived against England, in Galle, during the 2007-08 series. ",
            "Often looked to as the leader of the pace attack, after it became apparent that Lasith Malinga would not return to Tests, Welegedara has had a mixed time at the top level. He improved considerably throughout 2011, and then turned in his best performance for Sri Lanka at the end of the year, as he took 5 wickets for 52 in the first innings in Durban, to help set up Sri Lanka's maiden Test win in South Africa.

            "James Anderson had long proved himself as one of the most skilful and prolific fast bowlers in England's history when, with the final ball of the 2018 Test summer, he eclipsed Glenn McGrath as the most-prolific quick of all. His talents have been particularly apparent in Test cricket where his command of swing bowling, especially on his home grounds, has been the stuff of artistry, bearing comparison with any swing bowler in any age. He has been an integral part of three victorious Ashes campaigns and became the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets, leaving Ian Botham's previous benchmark of 383 a mere dot on the horizon. His one-day career has also had its moments as he gradually became adept at bowling in a more defensive fashion, but it is as an attacking swing bowler where he has had few peers.",
            "Anderson's 500th Test wicket came in September 2017 when he dismissed Kraigg Brathwaite in a Lord's Test against the West Indies. It was a delivery that illustrated his talent, coming down the slope to hit middle stump (his 501st - to bowl Kieran Powell - was even better). He became only the sixth player, and third pace bowler seamer after McGrath and Courtney Walsh, to reach the landmark and admitted to feeling emotional. \"Normally it's anger but today it was a bit more... not quite teary, but emotional. I don't get like that when trying to focus on my job and it took me a bit by surprise.\"",
            "By early 2023, he had overtaken Anil Kumble in the all-time Test wicket-takers list, and had the 700-mark firmly in his sights. Playing on past his 40th birthday, Anderson continued to generate decent pace and had became a master craftsman. When he missed the 2019 Ashes - he pulled up injured after four overs of the Edgbaston Test - it seemed as though time had caught up with him, but with his schedule stripped back after effectively giving up white-ball cricket after the 2015 World Cup, he pressed on and continued to thrive.",
            "Anderson has been something of a contradiction. He has had a reputation for being shy and uncommunicative off the field, except in the company of close friends, yet on the field his verbal aggression, which he has argued is necessary to conquer that diffident character, not always endeared him to opponents or critics.",
            "For the first six years of Anderson's international career, the best way to sum up his bowling was to paraphrase Mother Goose: when he's good, he's very, very good - and when he's bad, he's horrid. But when the force was with him, he was capable of irresistible spells, seemingly able to swing the ball round corners at an impressive speed.",
            "Anderson had played only three one-day games for Lancashire when he was hurried into England's one-day squad in Australia in 2002-03 as cover for Andy Caddick. He didn't have a number - or even a name - on his shirt, but a remarkable ten-over stint, costing just 12 runs, in century heat at Adelaide earned him a World Cup spot. There, he produced a matchwinning spell against Pakistan before a sobering last-over disaster against Australia.",
            "Five wickets followed in the first innings of his debut Test, against Zimbabwe at home in 2003, then a one-day hat-trick against Pakistan, but his fortunes waned. For a couple of years Anderson was a peripheral net bowler as attempts to change his action to avoid injury affected his pace and rhythm. That oft-predicted stress fracture kept him out for most of 2006, but he still made the Australian tour and the World Cup. However, as England's 2005 Ashes-winning attack began to fall apart, Anderson made his second coming - starting in Wellington on the 2007-08 tour of New Zealand, where he and Stuart Broad were united for the first time. The same opponents were blown away at Trent Bridge (Anderson 7 for 43) a few weeks later, during a summer that earned Anderson the honour of being named among Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year. He marked the award, given at the start of the 2009 season, by making the West Indians looked clueless at Chester-le-Street (nine wickets in the match).",
            "In 2010 Anderson came of age in a staggeringly comprehensive fashion. No longer content with being unplayable when the mood caught him, he took the decision to shelve the \"magic balls\" and concentrated on hammering out a rock-solid line and length, with dot balls and maidens his new holy grail. The upshot was a scintillating year in which he proved unhittable in every sense, with an economy rate that ramped up the pressure in every spell, and a range of weapons that made him a threat on every surface. ",
            "A career-best 11-wicket haul against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, when he came as close to unplayable as at any time in his career, was the prelude to a breakthrough tour of Australia in the winter of 2010-11. Anderson arrived to a torrent of doubters, who recalled his forlorn performance on the preceding Ashes four years earlier, in which he had taken five wickets at 82.60. But he left with a series-sealing 24 scalps at 26.04, and a reputation transformed. ",
            "Deadly with conventional swing and seam, and with a new line in reverse swing as well, he had become arguably the most complete fast bowler in the world. He was awarded the Freedom of Burnley - his home town - in 2012, which was also his benefit year, and also eased past Brian Statham's 252 Test wickets to become Lancashire's most successful England bowler. His increased range was demonstrated in India the following winter, when Anderson claimed 12 wickets at 30.25 but was described by MS Dhoni as \"the major difference between the two sides\".",
            "In 2013, fittingly at Lord's, a ground where enjoyed much success, he became the fourth England bowler to reach 300 Test wickets when he had Peter Fulton caught at slip. When he began the Ashes with a match-winning 10-wicket haul at Trent Bridge his form showed no signs of abating, but the following nine Tests against Australia were far less successful as a chastened England returned home after the battering down under in 2013-14.",
            "Anderson took 37 wickets in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India in 2014, but his reputation was sullied by a verbal confrontation in the first Test at Trent Bridge with India's Ravindra Jadeja and accusations of pushing and shoving on the way in the dressing room corridor. India insisted that his behaviour had become unacceptable, but the resulting ICC investigation could not separate the truth from the lies and both men got off lightly. The World Cup in the antipodes was another unhappy episode, as the curtain came down on Anderson's 194-game ODI career - another format in which he was England's leading wicket-taking exponent - after an ignominious group-stage exit.",
            "By then, England's Test bowling records were bound to fall his way. He passed Botham's record Test-wicket haul in the Caribbean and shortly afterwards reached 400 against New Zealand at Headingley. His fitness remained exemplary, his action as rhythmical as ever, and his appetite still powerful enough to imagine, as he passed his 33rd birthday, playing for another five years. A northern spring, Sri Lanka the opposition, cheered him with three five-wicket hails in successive Tests in Leeds and Chester-le-Street in 2016, but a shoulder injury marred his summer and he was innocuous on Indian pitches as England slumped to a 4-0 defeat that winter. ",
            "The 500-mark beckoned, however, and a fit-again Anderson averaged 14.10 during the home series against South Africa and West Indies. He was the pick of the attack as England were crushed in Australia yet again, and continued to rule the roost at home. When he bowled Mohammed Shami to complete England's 4-1 win over India and record his 564th Test wicket, McGrath's pace-bowling record was eclipsed - and there were tears on the outfield from Anderson, as he contemplated the retirement of his great mate Alastair Cook."

            "A left-arm fast bowler more suited to cold beer than high-quality champagne, Doug Bollinger added plenty of character to Australia's Test side during his two years around the group in 2009 and 2010. Nicknamed \"Doug the Rug\", after receiving some help in manufacturing hair from a previously barren crown, Bollinger promised to give 150,000% on his Test debut at his SCG home ground. Over the next two years, Bollinger was a semi-regular member of the side and picked up 50 Test wickets, irritating opposing batsmen with his angle and swing. Bollinger is known for making team-mates laugh, often on purpose, but at times by accident as well, as when he took a wicket in a Test against New Zealand and grabbed his shirt, wanting to kiss the national coat of arms, but slobbered on the sponsor's beer logo instead.

            "It was entirely typical that Dougie Brown's playing career at Warwickshire should end with him requiring carrying off the pitch. Never one to quit, never one to know when he was beaten, Brown - desperate to prove himself one more time after falling from favour during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign at the club - suffered a serious Achilles tendon injury in the field during a T20 match against Northants and was carried from the field for the last time only when it became obvious that there was simply no other choice. It was the only way it could have ended and the final act of an outstanding county career.",
            "Brown had first come to Warwickshire's attention as a fast bowler. Juggling his work as a PE teacher with his commitments as a cricketer with Scotland, it was far from unusual for Brown to travel overnight from his home in Stirling to undertake a trial or play a match, before making the long journey home the following night. Hard work was never an impediment for Brown.",
            "A junior player in Warwickshire's treble-winning season of 1994, he contributed more often in 1995 and then remained a key player for more than a decade. He was the leading wicket-taker in the country in 1997, exceeded 1,000 first-class runs in 2003 and averaged over 50 in 2004, the year his bowling played a huge role in Warwickshire's Championship success. With more than 500 first-class wickets and a batting average over 30, he was one of the leading all-rounders in domestic cricket for almost 10 years. His obvious commitment and determination made him a firm favourite at Edgbaston. ",
            "He also enjoyed success at international level. In Sharjah in 1997, in the second of his nine ODIs for England, he bowled Philo Wallace with the first ball of the match and had Brian Lara leg before with the third. England, led by Adam Hollioake, went on to win the tournament. ",
            "When England dispended of him, he represented Scotland in a further 16 ODIs and two T20Is. Already 36 before he made his international debut for the country of his birth, Brown still contributed in the 2007 Caribbean World Cup and the World T20 in South Africa later that year. He played one List A game (it was not an international) for Namibia, too, and coached them at the 2003 World Cup.",
            "He continued to play wholeheartedly for Barnt Green in the Birmingham League until the end of 2012, but coaching was quickly becoming more important to Brown. Appointed as Academy coach at Edgbaston when his old friend Ashley Giles was appointed as director of cricket in 2009, Brown was promoted to assistant coach and then to director of cricket ahead of the 2013 season when Giles moved on to England. Warwickshire subsequently won the NatWest T20 Blast under Brown in 2014 and finished as runners-up in both the other competitions. ",
            "Despite another trophy - the Royal London One Day Cup - in 2016, Brown was sacked by Warwickshire at the end of the season and replaced by his old friend, Giles. Brown was subsequently named as UAE coach in early 2017."

            "Prolific first-class runscorers occasionally have weaknesses found out against top-class opposition, and so it was with Dippenaar who quickly found that his tendency to play across and around his back-foot defensive strokes was costly against quality Test bowlers. He worked hard to rectify the problem. On good days, however, he can please the eye for six hours and more. He is not a tall man yet he bats like one, seemingly able to reach the pitch of every ball bowled on or outside off stump and drive it through the covers. The reach and the sweetness of the timing are the foundations of his game; his ability as a cover fielder is a bonus."

Impressive performances at the U-19 state level, including 8 for 47 against Tamil Nadu, earned him a place on the India U-19 tour of Sri Lanka in 2007. He continued the good work there and was rewarded with a spot in Mumbai's side for the Ranji one-dayers in 2008, as well as a contract with Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. In his first Ranji season, he emerged the tournament's most successful bowler, taking 42 wickets and invariably providing early breakthroughs for Mumbai, the eventual winners. The dream season continued with his inclusion in the Test squad for the tour of New Zealand in 2009.",
            "He did not get to play a match on the tour, and had to wait another five years to make his international debut, in the fourth ODI during India's tour of England in 2014. He picked up eight wickets at 18.62 in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka later that year, but opportunities since have been scarce, with his only chances in 2015 coming on ODI tours of Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.",
            "In domestic cricket, however, Kulkarni has established himself as one of the leading seam bowlers in the country, marrying accuracy to new-ball swing, and picking up over 200 first-class wickets. He has invariably performed in big matches: he picked up five-fors in the Ranji Trophy finals of 2008-09, 2012-13 and 2015-16, and helped Mumbai out of a sticky situation with the bat in the 2009-10 final, his second-innings 87 proving critical in a narrow win over Karnataka."

            "Jon Lewis, a consistent county wicket-taker with his skiddy medium-paced awayswingers, seemed destined to be a no-cap wonder after frequently being called up by England only to be left out at the last minute. It started in South Africa in early in 2005, when Lewis, a late addition to an injury-hit squad, was congratulated by his team-mates ahead of the rain-delayed start of the final Test at Centurion. It seemed a first cap was imminent: but it didn't happen then, or at home during 2005, even though Lewis rocked the Australians with four wickets in the T20 international victory at the Rose Bowl early in that famous tour, ripping out Symonds, Clarke and Ponting for ducks. ",
            "His ODI career also started well, with three wickets against Bangladesh, but the Aussies seemed to work him out after that. Suspicions remained that he just wasn't quick enough to be an international force, and although Lewis did finally get a Test cap against Sri Lanka at Trent Bridge in 2006 - and again started well, the first of his three wickets coming with his third ball - he was sidelined when Pakistan visited later that summer. ",
            "At 31 that might have been it, except as England's one-day attack continued to struggle with injuries and lack of form Lewis was the only quicker bowler to do the basics right. He retained his knack of grabbing early wickets and had become an integral part of England's one-day plans until he suffered an ankle injury during the victorious CB Series campaign in Australia. Even so, he was retained in the World Cup squad though played no part. ",
            "With the bat, he was an old-fashioned tailender, capable of the odd mighty blow, and he was named Gloucestershire captain in 2006 but couldn't bring success to the club. He stepped down after three years in charge after the 2008 campaign.",
            "He continued his very successful county career that saw him help Gloucestershire to seven trophies in five seasons between 1999 and 2005 with over 50 wickets in 2009, 2010 and 2011 - which proved to be his final year at Bristol after scoring over 500 runs in a season for the first time."

",

In 2003, he put Andrew Flintoff out of action with a beamer in the Old Trafford nets, and later broke Alex Gidman's hand at the ECB Academy. But three years later, he was inflicting the damage on his opponents instead, as he announced his Test arrival against Sri Lanka at Lord's with a fiery three-wicket burst, before overcoming cries of \"traitor\" from the British Pakistani fans at Headingley, as England sealed the series against his father's former countrymen. But England's management weren't convinced and Mahmood was overlooked for the subsequent Ashes opener at Brisbane, only to be recalled late in the series with no form or confidence to fall back on. Excellent in the field, he again showed promise with the ball in the subsequent World Cup but inconsistency continued to hamper his progress.",
            "When Peter Moores took over as England coach, Mahmood was dumped along with Duncan Fletcher's infatuation with pace above other considerations. Ironically, when Moores took the coaching job at Lancashire in 2009 Mahmood pushed hard for an England recall and was rewarded with a call-up to the one-day squad for South Africa. But all Mahmood's old flaws - the tendency to spray the ball around, and an unfortunate propensity to deliver no-balls - resurfaced in a Centurion T20 horror show: 4-0-61-1. He shuffled from international view once again. "

            "Perhaps no cricketer since Douglas Jardine has polarised opinion quite like Muthiah Muralidaran. For the believers, he's among the greatest to ever spin a ball. For the doubters, he's a charlatan undeserving of the game's greatest records, responsible for changes in the laws that they think have legitimised throwing. What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18. Whether Sri Lanka played at home, on pitches where he was often unplayable, or overseas, Murali was the go-to man for half a dozen captains. He seldom disappointed.",
            "Scion of a family with confectionery interests in Kandy, he first came to prominence during a tour game against Australia in 1992-93, when no less a batsman than Allan Border failed to pick him. From the outset, his action was an object of wonder or ridicule, depending on which side of the fence you stood. A deformed elbow was only part of the story. Murali had exceptionally supple wrists and a shoulder that rotated as rapidly as a fast bowler's at the time of delivery. A combination of all these factors combined to enable him to turn the ball far more than most orthodox finger-spinners, but it was only with his mastering the doosra, the one that went the other way or held its line, that he became Shane Warne's rival in the wicket-taking and greatness stakes. ",
            "The controversies always kept him company, yet Murali seldom lost his wide-eyed smile, or the ability to run through batting sides. Darrell Hair called him for throwing on Boxing Day in 1995, and Ross Emerson followed suit three years later. In 2004, he was asked to refrain from bowling his doosra, after it was found to exceed the 15-degree tolerance limit that had been agreed on after extensive analysis of his and other actions. While the sceptics continued to denigrate his achievements, Murali even bowled on television in a special cast, going through his entire repertoire to try and convince the doubters.",
            "Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa. "

            "Monty Panesar burst onto the scene for England in 2006 and quickly established himself as a national hero and fan favourite, with his black patka, languid action, wide eyes, eager (if a touch hapless) fielding, and generally effervescent mien on the field. ",
            "Though he shaped up briefly to be anointed the saviour of English spin bowling, that title eventually went to his old Northants colleague Graeme Swann, who had greater command of spin and dip on flat surfaces, and a nous that Panesar occasionally seemed to lack. The two combined in spectacular fashion in Mumbai in November 2012 for figures of 19 for 323, of which Panesar accounted for 11 wickets (including those of Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni twice). He took 17 wickets in five innings in that series to Swann's 20 in seven. Together they were the lynchpins of England 2-1 series win, the first time the team had won a series in India in 28 years. Earlier that year, Panesar had been nearly as prolific against Pakistan in the UAE, taking 14 wickets in the two Tests, but ending up on the wrong side of the 3-0 scoreline.",
            "Panesar was picked for England Under-19s in 2000, and made his first-class debut a year later against Leicestershire, where he took 8 for 131. A fine 2005 season (46 County Championship wickets at under 22) took him into the side for England's 2006 tour of India, where he made his Test debut in Nagpur, picking up his boyhood hero, Sachin Tendulkar, as his first Test wicket, and Rahul Dravid as his third. That summer, against a Pakistan line-up that included the likes of Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf and Younis Khan, Panesar spun England to a series win, taking 17 wickets in four Tests. Those performances took him ahead of Ashley Giles as England's leading spinner of the time. In the Ashes thrashing of 2006-07, Panesar provided a silver lining for his side with eight wickets in the Perth Test.",
            "He started the 2007 summer with 23 wickets in four Tests against West Indies, which brought a career-high No. 6 ICC ranking, but things began to go awry thereafter. He struggled in the following home series against India, and to a lesser extent away in Sri Lanka, lost his confidence, and was increasingly beset by critics who muttered about his lack of variety. Though he fared well in New Zealand, a tough 2008 summer, where Graeme Smith swept him to distraction in South Africa's series-clinching win in Edgbaston, blunted Panesar's perma-cheerful persona. ",
            "He was comprehensively outperformed by a resurgent Swann during his return to India in December 2008, and again in the Caribbean, where he lost his position as England's No. 1 spinner. He only played one Test in the 2009 Ashes, in Cardiff, where he batted through to the close in a remarkable tenth-wicket stand with James Anderson, reaffirming his cult status. ",
            "By the end of 2009, though the future of Panesar's international career looked doubtful, he took control on the first-class front, leaving his lifelong county Northamptonshire and moving to Sussex, where he rediscovered his vim and had a strong 2010 season, taking 52 wickets. ",
            "After the high of Mumbai 2012, there followed a disturbing deterioration in Panesar's professional and personal life alike. he was released by Sussex late in the 2013 season, after urinating from on high on a Brighton nightclub bouncer after he had been asked to leave. Essex gambled on him, but his form remained unconvincing, there were reports of unpredictable and difficult behaviour, and he was left out of the side for long periods. \n"

            "Stephen Parry, a left-arm spinner, had to build his Lancashire career primarily playing limited-overs cricket for his first decade in the game. It was a none-too-easy task but that has not prevented him winning England honours and being recognised as a crucial element in the Lancashire squad. ",
            "His skill as a T20 bowler was evident in 2015 when who finished as the country's joint leading wicket taker - alongside team-mate James Faulkner - in the NatWest T20 Blast with 25 wickets as Lancashire won the competition for the first time. But it was not enough to win him a place in England's World Twenty20 squad in India in 2016 as Hampshire's Liam Dawson edged him out.",
            "Parry played for Cumberland in Minor Counties cricket on his way to Lancashire honours and claimed a five-wicket haul on his first-class debut in 2007 against Durham University but opportunities were restricted because of the presence, in turn, of two other slow left-armers on the county staff: Gary Keedy and Simon Kerrigan.",
            "He was first called up for the England Lions in a 50-over match against India A at Worcester in July, 2010. No mean batsman, he scored a Second XI century in 2011 and captained the Lancashire team that won the Second XI one-day competition in 2012. ",
            "He first awakened the interest of the full England squad in 2013. Despite receiving a broken arm courtesy of throwdowns from Peter Moores, then Lancashire's coach, he did enough to catch the eye of the England selectors who called him up for the tour of West Indies and World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. Strikingly, his 5 for 17 in a 40-overs match against Surrey at Old Trafford had only been exceeded once before by a Lancashire bowler in one-day cricket. ",
            "He made his ODI debut against West Indies, in Antigua, on trip dominated by spin bowling and acquitted himself well, his 3 for 32 enough to take the man-of-the-match award.  Two T20 internationals followed in Barbados ahead of one game in the World T20 in Bangladesh later that month, but he was discarded after his fifth T20I, this time against Pakistan in Dubai, at the end of 2015.",
            "Ashley Giles, then England's one-day coach, gave him opportunities in T20 and ODI cricket and the pair joined forces again at the end of 2014 when Giles, sacked from his England role, became Lancashire's director of cricket.",
            "But it was Glen Chapple, Giles' successor, who finally gave him regular Championship opportunities. Ten years after his five wickets on first-class debut, he achieved it for a second time as Lancashire's defeat of Middlesex consigned them to a path that would end in relegation. An abiding love for Lancashire had kept him at the county, Parry suggested, and he aimed to make it worthwhile with a strong finish to his career."

It was with the bat that he made his first impression in Tests: Perera came within five runs of scoring a century on debut, against Pakistan at Sharjah, but he asserted himself as a bowler soon enough. His second-innings five-wicket haul helped wipe Bangladesh out in Dhaka, less than two weeks later.",
            "No big turner of the ball, and possessing only an arm ball as a variation, Perera's strengths lie in accuracy and persistence.  He has honed those skills by practicing spot-bowling intensively, on the advice of Muttiah Muralitharan, one of Perera's idols, alongside Saqlain Mushtaq. In his time in the Test side, Perera has proved a good fit for the attack's ethos of squeezing wickets from the opposition, and he has also been a fine partner for Rangana Herath when the two bowl from opposite ends.",
            "Perera had made rapid progress since starting his career at Sri Sumangala College, Panadura. He toured Australia with the Sri Lanka Under-19 team and, after he made his first-class debut for Panadura Sports Club, was drafted into the A side in 2001. He played one season for Chilaw Marians Cricket Club and holds the bowling record for the Under-23s with 55 wickets from seven matches in 2004.",
            "He had had some success in A team tours to England and Zimbabwe with both bat and ball, but continued to develop as a bowler through his time at Sri Lanka's Spin Bowling Academy, where he was coached by former offspinners Ashley Mallett and Ruwan Kalpage."

            "With a charging run-up, powerful delivery, worrying bounce and elongated appeal, Peter Siddle was a reassuringly consistent presence in Australia's Test attack and is part of Australia's illustrious 200-Test wickets club. A hard-working, hostile fast bowler who has not always been viewed as the epitome of subtlety, Siddle has been used as an enforcer, a workhorse and at times as the spearhead of Australia's bowling group. But he is also a man of contradictions, a tough rural Victorian who was a competitive woodchopper in his youth, yet since 2012 a vegan whose diet can consist of 15 to 20 bananas a day.",
            "Injuries hampered his early domestic career, with a shoulder reconstruction sidelining him for most of 2006-07 and further shoulder problems troubling him the following season. But he announced himself in the 2007-08 Sheffield Shield final where he took seven wickets with hostile bowling a flat SCG track against a Test-quality NSW batting line-up.",
            "First picked for the tour of India in 2008, Siddle made his Test debut in Mohali and hit Gautam Gambhir in the head with his first ball, before claiming Sachin Tendulkar as his maiden Test wicket. He became a regular in the Test team from that point and in October of 2009, he was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year, but a quiet home Test summer was followed by a stress fracture in his back, which required lengthy rehabilitation.",
            "His comeback could hardly have been more memorable. At the Gabba on the opening day of the 2010-11 Ashes series, Siddle celebrated his 26th birthday by becoming the ninth Australian to take a Test hat-trick. ",
            "Siddle was the heart and soul of the Australian attack, leading them manfully during a period of transition. He was a key contributor to the 5-0 Ashes success in 2013-14. But a preference for out-and-out pace from the selectors led to Siddle losing his spot in the team during the tour of South Africa in early 2014, and he was asked to work on regaining the yard of speed he had lost. ",
            "He would play just nine Tests over the next two years as Australia opted for a pace battery over control. His non-selection until the fifth Ashes Test in 2015 proved costly as he claimed six wickets in a winning dead-rubber at the Oval after the series was lost. He took his 200th Test wicket against New Zealand in November 2015 but was cast aside as Australia took a youth policy moving forward following the disastrous home defeat to South Africa. "

He had played three more first-class matches by the end of the 2012 season and took the opportunity thrown up by a Yorkshire injury crisis to impress in the Champions League T20, dismissing the India captain, MS Dhoni, in the match against Chennai Super Kings. He was invited to train with the Scotland squad in early 2013, and impressed enough to immediately win an ODI debut against Afghanistan. The following year, he was Scotland's leading wicket-taker, with 16 wickets at 23.37 apiece, as Scotland won the World Cup Qualifying tournament in New Zealand. "

However, a place in the national team has so far eluded him, with the selectors often opting for others with lesser performances ahead of Wijekoon. The nearest he came to selection was being part of the Test squad to New Zealand in 2004-05. A lively left-arm \nmedium-pacer and a left-hand batsman, he opened both the batting and the bowling for Tamil Union for many years before joining Chilaw Marians CC in 2003-04. Upul Chandana and Mahela Jayawardene have been the major influences in Wijekoon's career so far. He made his international debut in the home Test series against West Indies in July 2005, though with limited success, picking up two wickets. He was recalled for the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa after a two-year hiatus and the following year made it to the probables squad for the Champions Trophy."

            "A patient opening batsman with a sound technique, Bancroft made a debut for Australia as a batsman/keeper in a T20I against India in Sydney early in 2016. He enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2014-15 when he finished third on the Sheffield Shield run tally with 896 runs at 47.15. The highlight of his summer was a maiden double-century: he batted for more than 13 hours in scoring 211 against New South Wales, proof of the high price he places on his wicket. A call-up for Australia A followed and he used his feet and the sweep to great effect in negating India A's spinners when he made 150 in Chennai. Bancroft was then named in Australia's Test squad for the 2015 tour of Bangladesh, which was cancelled due to safety concerns, and he instead had to settle for another productive Shield campaign with 732 runs at 45.75. It was his attributes as a part-time glovesman that eventually brought him a T20 international debut but that did not shake the belief that it is in the longer form in which his greatest potential lies. Highly rated by his Western Australia coach Justin Langer, Bancroft had debuted for his state in one-day cricket at 18, but had to wait two more years to be given a chance in the Sheffield Shield side.",
            "Gloucestershire signed him as an overseas player for the early part of the 2016 season. It was a disappointing outcome as he made only one half-century in five matches, but they gave him an opportunity to continue his education in English conditions by re-signing him for the whole of 2017. Another commonplace season followed until an unbeaten 206 against Kent, spanning more than eight hours, added some substance to his season."

            "A skilful, subtle purveyor of slow left-arm darts, Danny Briggs was unable to prove himself in a brief flirtation with international cricket but instead flourished as one of the most effective limited-overs spinners in the county game. He was a key figure in Hampshire's prolonged spell of white-ball success between 2009 and 2015, and further stints at Sussex and Warwickshire have cemented his status as the leading wicket-taker in the history of the T20 Blast.",
            "His ability in one-day cricket first became apparent in 2010, when he took 31 wickets in Hampshire's victorious FPt20 campaign, and he soon found himself impressing for the England Lions in the Regional Four-Day Competition in the Caribbean the following spring. While his Championship opportunities were somewhat limited, he continued to impress in white-ball cricket to the extent that England gave him an ODI debut against Pakistan in 2012. ",
            "He went to the World T20 in Sri Lanka later that year - postponing his wedding as a result - though played only once, and was taken to pieces by Aaron Finch during his record 156 at the Ageas Bowl before going for 53 in a wicketless final England appearance in 2014. ",
            "But he continue to excel as Hampshire reached Finals Day six years in a row, and when he left as a 24-year-old, he had 119 wickets for them in the format, at an economy rate below 7. He rarely spun the ball much, but was a canny operator who could deliver his subtle variations from both sides of the wicket. After moving to Sussex, he earned a surprise Lions recall in 2018 after another prolific Blast campaign and in 2022 -  now at Warwickshire - he became the first man to pass 200 wickets in the competition."

When England had to replace an entire squad due to Covid for the ODI series with Pakistan in 2021, Carse was among the new faces and he impressed with his deck-hitting style, taking a five-for in the third match. ",

With England's seamer stocks low, a T20I debut came towards the end of the season, and he eventually became part of the ODI World Cup squad in India as an injury replacement for Reece Topley.",
            "South Africa-born but having honed his craft in the northeast, Carse pushed his way on to England's radar with an impressive 2019 season, winning a place on the Lions tour to Australia. He was Durham's joint-leading wicket-taker in the Royal London Cup, and claimed 35 wickets at 26.85 in the Championship, as he put two seasons of injury frustration behind him. In Australia, Carse claimed eight wickets in four matches as the Lions went unbeaten, which included a maiden first-class win over Australia A in a day-night match at the MCG.",
            "Carse had first shone for Durham at both ends of a 2016 summer that also saw him succumb to injury in mid-season. He made his first-class debut against Durham MCCU and finished with 17 wickets in eight matches."

            "A shoulder reconstruction ruined Shane Harwood's 2009-10 and kept him to two FR Cup outings, but despite turning 36 before the start of the next summer, he retained his Cricket Victoria contract. It was especially disappointing for Harwood to sit out of the season after he had six months earlier become Australia's third oldest ODI debutant, behind Bob Simpson and Bob Holland. The call-up came in South Africa, where he also played two Twenty20s and made his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals, taking a wicket with his first ball in the competition. The success came at the end of the 2008-09 season, in which Harwood was the leading FR Cup wicket taker with 24 at 16.25. His shoulder problem had threatened to derail the previous summer and he finished the season with groin trouble, just one in a long list of injuries throughout Harwood's career. ",
            "In 2006-07, he claimed 26 Pura Cup wickets at 30.26 and 13 at 16.30 in the domestic one-dayers as his sharp pace and awkward bounce dried up the opposition's runs. The standout moment was undoubtedly his surprise call-up into the Australia team for their Twenty20 match against England in January 2007. There were other highlights: he claimed a career-best 6 for 51 against New South Wales at the MCG and improved his record a month later with 6 for 38 against the same team at Sydney. But four separate health problems interrupted his progress and his propensity for sustaining injuries in unusual fashion continued. He hurt a calf walking down some stairs at the MCG during a match and missed games with a side strain and two separate buttock injuries. "

            "When he burst onto the scene in the early 2000s, Amit Mishra impressed with his classical, attacking legspin, relying mostly on flight and a big legbreak, while surprising batsmen with the odd googly. However, with two giant spinners - Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh - at the peak of their powers, there wasn't a place available for him in India's squad.",
            "Mishra made his international debut in 2003 during an ODI triangular in Bangladesh, but he had to wait until 2008 to get his first go in Tests. That opportunity came after an injury forced Kumble out of the Mohali Test against Australia. Mishra had a dream start to his Test career, becoming the sixth Indian to take a five-wicket haul on debut, foxing the Australians with his variations and finishing the series with 14 wickets from three Tests. With his debut series coinciding with Kumble's last, it was the opening he needed to establish himself as India's first-choice legspinner. But, his inability to extract turn on benign pitches and the lack of accuracy were his failings as other spinners overtook him in the pecking order. ",
            "Mishra's struggles in international cricket aside, he has remained a vital cog for the Haryana Ranji side over the years, collecting a bagful of wickets. But, it's his performances in the IPL, where he has been one of the best spinners, and the only bowler to pick up three hat-tricks, that keep him in the limelight. The hat-tricks came for three different teams - Delhi Daredevils (2008), Deccan Chargers (2011) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (2013). In 2015, Mishra returned to the team he first played for, with Daredevils paying INR 3.5 crore to secure his services.",
            "A strong display in the 2013 IPL, during which he kept the batsmen guessing with his variations in flight and pace, earned him a call-up for India's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy in England and the tour to Zimbabwe, almost two years after his last international appearance. He didn't disappoint, picking up 18 wickets at 11.61 in five ODIs against Zimbabwe, and equaling Javagal Srinath's record for the most wickets in a bilateral series. Mishra's good form continued into the World T20 the following year in Bangladesh, where he picked up 10 wickets at 14.70, while only conceding 6.68 runs per over, as India adopted a three-spinner strategy and finished runners-up to Sri Lanka."

It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new. ",
            "There were plenty of frustrating times as well. Shami was hopeful of a return to the Indian team in early 2016, but a hamstring injury ruled him out a limited-overs tour of Australia and the Asia Cup in February. He was selected in a 15-man squad for the World T20 in March, but was unable to break into the XI having spent a year out of international cricket. ",
            "Shami hails from Uttar Pradesh, but plays first-class cricket for Bengal from where he was noticed. He had played only 15 first-class and 15 List A games when he was drafted into India's ODI team to play Pakistan in Delhi in January 2013. He showed the faith wasn't misplaced and returned figures of 9-4-23-1 in a 10-run win, thus becoming only the eighth bowler, and the first Indian, to bowl four or more maiden overs on his ODI debut. His Test debut, which happened in November that year against the touring West Indies, was even more spectacular. He reverse-swung the old ball appreciably,  and at good pace, in the two-match series to take 11 wickets at 16.54. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs against England in Nottingham. "

            "Andre Nel was a muscular, bludgeoning fast bowler who belied his conservative Afrikaans upbringing by amassing one of South African cricket's most chequered disciplinary records. ",
            "Nel was tipped from an early age as a future international and he first made the headlines in February 2001, when he felled his hero Allan Donald with a fierce bouncer in a domestic first-class match - and burst into tears when Donald was forced to leave the field. Later that year Nel was one of five South African players found guilty of smoking marijuana during the tour of the West Indies. And he was sent home from an A tour of Australia in 2003 after being found to be driving under the influence of alcohol.",
            "He finally established himself as a permanent member of the Test team during the home series against West Indies in 2003-04 - and was only in trouble once, for making gestures to Chris Gayle. ",
            "Nel came into his own during South Africa's tour of Australia at the end of 2005, where he was an intimidating presence with 14 wickets and an attacking mindset. However, during a return series at home, he took only six wickets, and was involved in a heated argument with Adam Gilchrist in the second Test after being slammed for runs. ",
            "Nel chipped in with wickets and more than a mouthful of words and cheeky grins against India at home in 2006-07, but will probably be remembered most from the Test series for being at the receiving end of a big six and a famous impromptu dance from Indian bowler Sreesanth. New secured a place in the 2007 World Cup squad but wasn't a certainty on the final team sheet. However, his spells against England and Bangladesh showed what he brought to the attack and his commitment was never questioned. ",
            "With South Africa settling on a young fast-bowling attack, led by Dale Steyn, opportunities were increasingly limited and Nel announced his international retirement in March 2009.\n"

            "Ashley Noffke bounced into a Cricket Australia contract and on to an Ashes tour in 2001 and has stayed in the back of the national selectors' minds ever since. In three seasons leading up to a disrupted 2008-09, he rediscovered the penetration that earned early comparisons with Glenn McGrath, and heavy contributions with bat and ball led to national Twenty20 and ODI debuts in 2007-08. While his first international act was to be run-out without facing a ball against New Zealand, he returned to capture 3 for 18 and played the second Twenty20 of the summer against India. Staying with the squad for the opening match of the CB Series, he overcame a nervous first over to collect 1 for 46 in front of his home supporters at the Gabba. ",
            "A place in the Test squad for the West Indies followed, but he was not called to make his debut and then missed a spot on the India tour. The next summer was stalled by a nagging hip injury, which led to nine games for Queensland and a lost national contract. When offered a reduced deal for 2009-10 by the state, which no longer viewed him as a first-choice limited-overs player, he took up a two-year appointment with Western Australia. His first summer with the Warriors was mixed; he topped their FR Cup wicket tally with 10 at 24.40, but in the Sheffield Shield his 10 at 52.20 was a disappointing result. In his last uninterrupted season with Queensland he had collected 51 first-class wickets and scored 741 runs, making him the third Australian behind George Giffen and Greg Matthews to capture the 50-wicket, 500-run season double. Nobody in either discipline could match Noffke at Queensland as he tried to drag them off the bottom of the Pura Cup table, and he was recognised as the country's State Player of the Year. ",
            "It was a satisfying set of jumps after he struggled between 2003 and 2005 with back and ankle problems that sat next to inflated averages. Hoping to enjoy endless summers, he seemed to suffer from off-season stints with Middlesex and Durham that twice ended in early flights home. Noffke's Ashes experience also finished in the same way after he rolled his ankle attempting a soccer-style run-out in the tour match against Sussex. It was a painful conclusion to an encouraging trip of three games, but he lost his national contract the following year before recapturing it with 41 first-class victims at 22.65 in 2002-03. The return gained him a second tour with the Australians, and he played two games in the West Indies on the way to re-joining Middlesex and picking up a back problem. There were some difficult years before Noffke earned a recall to Australia A colours in 2006-07 for a trip to Pakistan. His 30 Pura Cup wickets at 24.30 were complemented by two half-centuries and a strong FR Cup campaign led to the Queensland Player of the Year prize and a spot in Australia's preliminary Twenty20 world championship squad.

            "Few medium-pacers had generated as much hype before bowling a ball in first-class, let alone international, cricket as had Munaf Musa Patel, the young boy from the little town of Ikhar in Bahruch, Gujarat. Kiran More had seen him bowl in the nets and sent him straight to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai to train under TA Sekhar and Dennis Lillee. Soon he was being hailed as the fastest man in Indian cricket. Then, even as Baroda and Gujarat vied for his services, Munaf chose Mumbai, after Sachin Tendulkar had taken special interest in him and had a word with the authorities in the Mumbai Cricket Association. Even then Munaf's first-class career was anything but smooth as he spent more time recovering from various injuries than actually playing.",
            "Strongly built though not overly tall, Munaf gradually gathers momentum in his approach to the crease, before releasing the ball with a windmill-whirl of the hands. His priority, in his early years, was to bowl quick. And it was this that first caught the eye of More and others. Later, he added reverse swing to his repertoire and troubled batsmen with a well-directed yorker. After plenty of speculation and close calls he finally received a call from the national selection panel for the second Test against England in March 2006, after an impressive performance for the Board President's XI saw him pick up 10 English wickets for 91 runs. In Mohali a week later, he ended with 7 for 97, the best performance by an Indian fast bowler on Test debut. A consistent series against West Indies later that year meant Munaf had established himself as a regular member of the side. ",
            "Then came the lull as Munaf, like most of India's new crop of fast bowlers, began to fade away after a good start. He lost pace at an alarming rate, and seemed intent on rebranding himself as back-up seamer as opposed to a pace spearhead. He soon lost his place in the Test side, and despite a handful of average ODI performances, was a left-field selection for the New Zealand tour in 2009. He did a reasonable job in India's win in Hamilton, but a schedule packed with the occasional home Tests in between ODIs and Twenty20s meant he rarely stayed in the radar for long. Injuries to Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth in the lead-up to the Sri Lanka tour in 2010 gave him another opportunity to impress.",
            "Munaf's career continued to be dogged by injuries, but in an ironic twist, he was the beneficiary of one when Praveen Kumar was forced out of India's 2011 World Cup squad. In stepped Munaf to take his place as India's third seamer and he ended the tournament as India's third-highest wicket-taker behind Zaheer and Yuvraj Singh, with 11 scalps. His consistent performances prompted bowling coach Eric Simons to call him the unsung hero of India's World Cup victory.",
            "Yet again, though, the high did not last long and within a few months Munaf was once again dropped from the national side in all three formats. Nevertheless, he continued to play domestic cricket for Baroda."

He possesses a number of cunning variations, the most dangerous one being a devilishly disguised slower ball. At the same time he can generate impressive pace, and regularly hit yorkers, which makes him particularly dangerous both at the start and the death of any innings.",

Thrown into the deep end, Raees made his ODI debut in the semi-finals of the tournament, after Mohammad Amir pulled out with a back injury at the very last minute."

He had a sparky and strong-minded personality to go along with his talent and won plaudits for his displays at schoolboy level and for Yorkshire's Academy. Graham Roope, his school coach, said that he was \"far too mature for most schoolboy opponents of his age, and he can bat very well in addition to being a fearsome bowler.\" ",
            "He was also a rare example of an English street cricketer, much in the Pakistan tradition. The neighbour's wall that he used to play cricket against turned out to house the president of Windhill CC in the Bradford League. He was invited to nets as a consequence - proof, if any more was needed, of the natural talent available to English cricket if horizons are broadened.",
            "He endured a couple of slow seasons at Yorkshire as injuries restricted his development, and he managed only a solitary appearance in 2006, but having changed his action to avoid a repetition of his stress fracture and finally allied consistency to his undoubted talent, he was given a first-team chance following the promotion of Tim Bresnan to the national squad. He claimed 40 wickets and scored 445 runs for Yorkshire in their 2009 Championship campaign, and was subsequently named in England's Test squad for their tour to Bangladesh in February 2010, much to the player's own surprise.  England saw pace, an ability to reverse swing the ball on dry surfaces and plentiful ambition.",
            "The decisive factor in his call-up was an impressive stint with the England Performance Programme in South Africa a few months earlier, when he caught the eye of the senior management, including Andy Flower. With England opting to rest Stuart Broad for the home series against Bangladesh, Shahzad made his debut in the second Test at Old Trafford. \"He looks like an impressive young man,\" said Flower, \"and how well he does will be determined by himself.\" ",
            "That, though, marked a peak for Shahzad. Although he made occasional one-day international appearances - and was a reserve quick on the 2010-11 Ashes tour, seriously considered but ultimately not selected in Adelaide - he could not command a regular place in the side and drifted out of contention after the 2011 World Cup through a mixture of form and injury. Domestically, life also became difficult. He was released by Yorkshire - who cited issues with his team spirit - and was taken on loan by Lancashire for the rest of 2012 season. When Lancashire were relegated that summer, and wavwered over whether to offer him a full-time deal, he opted to move to Nottinghamshire in an attempt to revive his career.",
            "Eight months on, Shahzad had asked enough questions of himself to conclude that his Yorkshire departure was a divorce with faults on both sides. But while he accepted he was \"stubborn\" in the way he resisted Yorkshire's attempts to curb his natural instincts as a bowler, he was far from repentant, insisting that he remained an attacking bowler best suited to chasing wickets by intimidating batsmen with short, sharp bursts and plentiful yorkers and skiddy bouncers. A holding role was not for him.",
            "Only 22 Championship wickets at nearly 50 in 2013 did nothing to support his conviction that he knew his own strengths.  He also admitted to being \"infuriated\" when he was told he would miss out in the YB40 final at Lord's because Stuart Broad, Notts' England quick, was available for the final. But Jake Ball, Notts' hero of the semifinal, succumbed to injury and Shahzad was spared. Three wickets in the YB final at Lord's as Nottinghamshire beat Glamorgan finally gave him something to smile about. Notts' appointment of Andy Pick as their bowling coach ahead of the 2014 season gave Shahzad another chance to find the mentor he so desperately needed.",
            "Instead, he prospered more in one-day cricket than the four-day game and Sussex became his fourth county in slightly more than two years as he looked to Mark Robinson, the county's coach, to resurrect an England career, that at 28, many presumed to be behind him. A career-best five-for in early season against Worcestershire suggested Sussex could rehabilitate him, as they had done others, but injury limited him to only five Championship games.",
            "The move did not go entirely to plan with Shahzad's form and fitness patchy. He left Sussex in the middle of the 2017 season, by mutual agreement, adamant even then, at 31, that he still had much to offer.\n"

Shaw's innings was then the highest score in school cricket. ",

He damaged anterior cruciate ligaments and damaged his cartilage when he landed awkwardly while celebrating the dismissal of Moeen Ali in a NatWest Blast tie against Worcestershire and missed the rest of the season in embarrassing circumstances.  The possibility that he could spend up to a year out of the game did not dissuade nine counties from chasing his signature before he opted to join Warwickshire on a three-year deal.",
            "England were watching Stone's recovery with concern, too, because he bowled some of the fastest spells in county cricket in 2015 and was selected for an England Performance Programme development camp bin South Africa before he was beset by the back trouble that had also afflicted him earlier in his career. The highlight was a career-best 5 for 44 against Kent, extolled by his captain Alex Wakely as one of the quickest spells he had seen while in the field.",
            "Stone, from Norwich, starred for England Under-19s on their tour of South Africa in February 2013 and registered the best match bowling figures for England in a youth Test with a return of 11 for 79 against South Africa Under-19s in Paarl. He broke the record set by Richard Pearson in 1991. He also filled in as skipper for Shiv Thakor. Northants increasingly benefited from his developing threat. In five Championship matches in Northants' abject Division One season in 2014 he was not overawed by the experience and, approaching his 21st birthday, finished top of the county's Championship averages. ",
            "His comeback eventually came mid-way through the 2017 season. While he managed just one first-class game that season, he bowled with impressive pace - in excess of 92 mph - as part of the Birmingham side that made it to the final of the Blast T20 competition to provide a reminder of his enduring qualities."

South Africa were struggling at 142 for 7 before Zondeki and Gary Kisten added 150 for the eighth wicket.

            "Tall and well-built in the tradition of Punjabi fast bowlers, Rauf comes with the Rashid Latif seal of approval and joined the national squads for the series against South Africa and Bangladesh in 2002-03. He is capable of generating a fair amount of pace with a natural action that brings the ball back into the right-hander, but it is his ability to extract awkward bounce that has been the key to his successes and development so far. He toured India with the Pakistan A team in December 2003, and although, like his teammates, he had a generally poor series, he bowled a couple of hostile spells. Consistent performances in the domestic circuit handed him a call-up to the Pakistan one-day side for the fifth ODI against Zimbabwe in Sheikhupura in January 2008. In his third match, against Bangladesh, he picked up his first Man-of-the-Match award. "

            "Tim Ambrose could be forgiven for considering himself the forgotten man of English cricket. In the last of his 11 Tests, in Barbados in early 2009, Ambrose made an unbeaten 76 and kept tidily enough in tricky conditions as West Indies batted for the best part of 200 overs.",
            "Sent back to county cricket and ordered to score more runs, he duly made a century for England Lions against the touring West Indies and another against Hampshire in the Championship. But the selectors never rang again. Not even to offer an explanation.",
            "Perhaps they felt his batting was over-reliant upon the cut. Perhaps they felt that he was prone to fluctuations in form that rendered him somewhat unreliable. But in an age when many keepers are manufactured, Ambrose was highly accomplished with the gloves and, by jettisoning him when he was just 26, England probably never saw the best of him.",
            "Born in Australia, Ambrose utilised the British passport he gained via his mother to move to the UK as a 17-year-old in 2000. He soon signed for Sussex and, as naturally gifted keeper and batsman, he made his first-class debut the following year and, by 2003, the year Sussex won the first Championship title in their history, he had gained the lion's share of the keeping duties from Matt Prior. He also scored more than 900 runs at an average in excess of 40.",
            "The contest between the two of them was to be a theme of Ambrose's career. Even though there were times when he took the gloves from Prior for Sussex and England, Prior always returned stronger to reclaim his position.",
            "For that reason, Ambrose took the decision to leave Sussex at the end of 2005 and make a new start at Warwickshire. He made a century in his second first-class game for the team and started the 2007 season with a career-best 251 not out against Worcestershire. The England selectors took notice.",
            "His Test debut came in New Zealand. After a half-century on debut, he made a century at Wellington in his second match that turned the series in England's favour. But he was unable to sustain that form and, by the time England left for their tour of India, he was Prior's reserve once again. His one return, for that game in Barbados, came when Prior flew home to witness the birth of his first child.",
            "Ambrose's form fell away sharply in 2010 and he averaged only 13 with the bat. He later revealed he had been suffering from an episode of depression and, by the end of that season with his contract finished and his love for the game ebbing, he cleared his locker at Edgbaston in expectation that his career was over."

He erased the memories of being caned for 44 runs off his first four overs, and of two fruitless home Tests against New Zealand, when he emerged one of India's leading fast bowlers in their historic tour of Pakistan in 2003-04. He was particularly lethal in a couple of sessions in the third Test in Rawalpindi, where he consistently swung the ball away, and snapped up a then career-best 4 for 63. In addition, his uninhibited batting and a megawatt smile endeared him to crowds in a manner even he found difficult to fathom.",
            "That comeback fades in comparison to the one he made in 2008-09. A stress fracture ruled him out of cricket in 2005, and threatened to end his career. For three years he could hardly play any cricket. He had to undergo a back surgery before which he was not sure he would be able to bowl again. \"If I were to go back,\" WV Raman, the Tamil Nadu coach who supported him throughout the hiatus said, \"to what all happened when he was told he would have to go for a surgery, it would take me two days to rattle on.\" With a remodelled action and the same unwavering spirit, he started the long road back through the first season of the IPL in 2008. His 11 wickets for Chennai Super Kings included a hat-trick. A successful Ranji season followed, and his 36 wickets at 17.50 took Tamil Nadu through to the semi-final. Eventually the national recall came, when Munaf Patel sustained a groin injury during the five-ODI series in Sri Lanka in January 2009. He then made it back to the Test squad for the tour of New Zealand, but never got a game. He captained the Tamil Nadu Ranji side, and reminded the selectors yet again that he wasn't a finished article, by bowling economically for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 IPL. He was rewarded with a call-up to the Twenty20 squad for the home series against New Zealand and the ICC World Twenty20. ",
            "Before the injury struck he bowled with a whippy, quick-arm action and had the ability to bowl quicker deliveries, yorkers or bouncers without a perceptible change in action. His open-chested action, combined with a tendency to bowl wide from the crease, lulled batsmen into believing that the ball would come in with the arm. As a result of this, when the ball swung away, or even straightened, he could be difficult to tackle. Not much of that has changed in his remodelled action. The perceptible change is in the way he starts his run-up, where he sort of tiptoes for the first few steps - almost as if unsure of the ground he is going to run on, before easing in. "

Most of his county cricket so far has been in the one-day, in which he impressed enough in 2012 to be named Nottinghamshire's Young Player of the Year and be awarded a one-year contract extension. ",

            "A fast bowler from the Frankston-Peninsula club in Melbourne, Scott Boland had been a stalwart of the domestic game with a brief opportunity in limited-overs internationals when he made a remarkable start to his Test career at the age of 32 by ripping through England at his home ground the MCG with 6 for 7. He became just the second male Indigenous Test player for Australia after Jason Gillespie and ended his debut series with a bowling average of 9.55.",
            "Boland made his Victoria debut in 2011-12, but it was not until 2013-14 that he enjoyed an extended run in the Sheffield Shield side. A consistent performer, Boland collected another 25 wickets in the 2014-15 Shield season and in 2015-16 earned an unexpected call as a standby player for Australia's squad for the Hobart Test against West Indies. The promotion came after Boland collected a career-best 7 for 31 in a Shield win over Western Australia. "

            "Stuart Clark is a tall and lanky opening bowler who was initially bracketed by the national selectors as \"in the Glenn McGrath mould\", but he created his own category with strong displays over 24 Tests. He fitted in perfectly in his opening appearances - he replaced McGrath, who was caring for his sick wife - and at the age of 30 experienced a dream start as the Player of the Series with 20 wickets at 15.75 against South Africa. A gamble for the first game at Cape Town, he collected his baggy green and earned his side a victory with 5 for 55 and 4 for 34, the third-best match figures by an Australian debutant behind Bob Massie and Clarrie Grimmett. ",
            "His home welcome was equally impressive as he helped up-end England with his extra lift, gained from his 197cm height, and regular seam movement. An uncomfortable prospect, especially early in a spell, he picked up 26 wickets at 17 in the Ashes to show there was life for Australia's bowling contingent after McGrath. Clark captured at least one victim in all ten innings against England and missed out only once in his opening nine Tests. Just when England thought they had left their Clark nightmares behind he popped up at Hampshire on a short-term visit and broke Michael Vaughan's hand. ",
            "While Clark quickly became a fixture in the longer form, he was dropped from the one-day team during that season's CB Series and was considered too expensive for a 2007 World Cup berth. He vowed to improve his control and won a Caribbean reprieve when Brett Lee turned his ankle in New Zealand. There was one game against Ireland and he did not disappoint in more intermittent appointments, finishing with 39 ODI caps. After 34 Test wickets were added to his collection at an average of 26.52 against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies in 2007-08, his hold on a Test place became less secure. He was dropped in India in 2008 before struggling with an elbow injury at home, the surgery ruling him out of both series against South Africa. ",
            "Called for the one-day tournament against Pakistan, he made a steady return in the United Arab Emirates instead of delivering long spells in the County Championship in preparation for the Ashes tour. He played two games in the defeat and started strongly at Leeds, but was unable to make an impact after being preferred to Nathan Hauritz at The Oval. He hasn't retired from internationals, but the rest of his career will be spent at New South Wales, who he captained either side of a back injury in 2009-10.",
            "A former real-estate agent in Sydney who crams study for a masters degree in commerce, Clark had to wait to strike the right market after a battle with his body as much as his talent. Clark held a Cricket Australia contract after a 45-wicket season in 2001-02 before losing it a summer later when struck by ankle and rib injuries. Hernia surgery was next on the list followed quickly by a leg problem, but he collected 40 breakthroughs in 2004-05 to re-impress Trevor Hohns and his selection gang. "

            "As an eight-year-old only child watching the 2005 Ashes series, Mason Crane was inspired by the bewitching displays of Shane Warne. From that moment he wanted to be a legspinner. Twelve years later he made his England debut in Twenty20 cricket and to cap the summer, at 21, he was chosen for England's Ashes tour party.",
            "Life had not always been that rewarding. When his home county, Sussex, left him out of their Under-14 squad he was bereft - for many a lad that would be the end of the story - but he was fortunate enough to be a pupil at Lancing College whose cricket master, Raj Maru, was a former Hampshire left-arm spinner and involved with the county academy. With the help of Maru and the Hampshire academy spin coach, Darren Flint, he soon won England call-ups at England U-17 and U-19 level.",
            "Crane made his Hampshire 1st XI debut against Surrey at the Ageas Bowl and took 2 for 35 as he dismissed Kumar Sangakkara - quite a first wicket - with a rank full toss and Vikram Solanki, stumped in more orthodox fashion. A few weeks later, against Warwickshire at the Ageas Bowl, Crane became the youngest Hampshire player to take a five-wicket haul in the Championship.",
            "Crane's second season was harder going, although only Ryan McLaren took more than his 31 Championship wickets. He was hardly used in the T20 Blast but had long, career-forming bowls in the Royal London Cup. ",
            "A winter was planned with the former Australia legspinner Stuart MacGill in Sydney. Back-to-back seven wickets hauls for Gordon CC in Australia earned him a call-up to the New South Wales side in the Sheffield Shield, making him the first overseas player since Imran Khan in 1984/85 to play State cricket in Australia and his reputation was further enhanced when he impressed in the 2017 North vs South series in the UAE.",
            "England's growing interest was apparent when the national selector, James Whitaker, expressed frustration over Crane's omission from a Hampshire Championship side early in 2017 (he was to play only half the 14 matches and 16 wickets at 44.69 was nothing to write home about), but like several English legspinners he was making a home for himself in Twenty20. Ahead of an excellent Blast season, England gave him his first two T20Is the first on his home ground against South Africa, and AB de Villiers was his maiden international victim. ",
            "His call-up to the Ashes tour party that winter was less justified by statistics, and he had a tough time on debut in Sydney, his single wicket costing 193 runs as he leaked more than four runs per over, but it was important to retain perspective given he was still only 20 years old.",
            "In 2018, he played through pain-killing injections in the Royal London Cup after suffering a stress fracture that kept him out of action for the rest of the season, and he had a mixed time of it the following summer: he was again prolific in white-ball cricket, but struggled badly in the Championship, returning five wickets at an average over 100 in his six appearances.

But he failed to hit those heights as regularly as he would have liked in a brief international career, playing only one more Test and a handful of limited-overs games stretched across a five-year period and decided to call it quits in 2017, using his wife's British passport to sign for Glamorgan as a local player at the age of 26. ",
            "De Lange hails from Tzaneen in the northern-most Limpopo province and was discovered at a local academy by scouts from Northern Provincial Union. He moved to Centurion and made his first-class debut for Easterns in the 2010-11 season. He attended the national academy before being contracted by Titans.",
            "After 13 first-class matches, he was called up to the South Africa A squad to face the touring Australians in November 2011, and he impressed with five wickets in Potchefstroom. This led to his inclusion in the Test squad, and an injury to Vernon Philander meant he was thrown into the side as a 21-year-old. Despite his success on debut, he was expensive in his second Test, and was overtaken in the pecking order by Kyle Abbott.",
            "De Lange had more success in limited-overs cricket and proved to be a handy death bowler. He defended seven runs off the final over in the third T20 against New Zealand in 2012 to ensure South Africa sealed the series. That year, de Lange was picked up by Kolkata Knight Riders for the IPL but only played three games. Shortly after the tournament, he suffered a stress fracture that impacted his ability to play in the 2012-13 season. ",
            "His rehabilitation included remodeling his action to ensure more stability at the crease but had to wait until mid-2014 to show it at international level again. A solitary game on the limited-overs visit to Zimbabwe in August 2014 was followed by a one-off appearance on the 2015 World Cup recce trip to Australia and a sprinkling of matches against West Indies at home. De Lange lost ground to some of the younger bowlers, and missed out on the 2015 World Cup, and leaked runs in what proved to be his final ODI, against England in early 2016.",
            "He remained a regular on the T20 circuit, with stints at Guyana Amazon Warriors, Barbados Tridents and Mumbai Indians, and decided in early 2017 to take the plunge and sign a three-year deal at Glamorgan. He made an immediate impact, with strong returns in all formats, but shone particularly in the T20 Blast campaign, taking 18 wickets as the club reached Finals Day. ",
            "He missed much of the 2018 summer with a hamstring injury, but was successful again a year later, earning him deals in the Abu Dhabi T10 and in the inaugural season of the Hundred. He remains capable of hitting speeds of 90mph/145kph, and retains a penchant for clubbing boundaries, as he proved with a 35-ball 58* against Surrey in early 2019."

            "A slight man but nevertheless powerful batsman who has a sound technique, Indika de Saram broke into the national side in the 1999-2000 tour of Zimbabwe. However, he languished at number six or seven in the order and was never really given an opportunity to express his full potential. He was educated at St Thomas' College in Matara, with whom he also kept wicket and became one of the most consistent scorers in the country. The highlight of his schools career was when he scored 304 runs in just 149 balls, including 25 sixes and 19 fours at the Uyanwatte Stadium against Sri Devanand College, Ambalangoda. He was a regular in the A team before breaking into the national team. He was dropped from the side in 2001 and eight years later, made a comeback when he was included in the Twenty20 squad against the touring Indians and later for the ICC World Twenty20 in England. "

Living in their barracks, Ebadat dreamt of bowling like Brett Lee one day. His dream came true when he took part in the 2016 Robi Pacer Hunt in Faridpur, crisscrossing 342km southwest from his hometown Sylhet. He was one of the top three bowlers, and was duly picked by the scouts to a training camp in Dhaka.",

It was followed by a draft pick in the BPL, by Rajshahi Kings. But Ebadat's breakthrough came at the start of the 2018-19 domestic season, having taken 21 wickets in the BCL first-class tournament. It included a 10-wicket haul against North Zone, including international batsmen Najmul Hossain Shanto, Marshall Ayub and Mosaddek Hossain."

            "A wicketkeeper first and a batsman second, Ben Foakes' excellence behind the stumps for Surrey quickly earned him the reputation as the best gloveman in the country after he cemented his spot in their side in 2016. That form and an injury to Jonny Bairstow earned him a Test debut in Sri Lanka in 2018-19, and he proved that he could bat too with a classy hundred on debut in Galle, while his keeping to the spinners was almost faultless as England won 3-0.",
            "Bairstow was soon back as the first-choice keeper, and even after he was dropped following an underwhelming run with the bat, a disappointing county campaign cost Foakes a spot on England's winter tour to New Zealand, with Jos Buttler preferred. He admitted that he had stopped enjoying the game in 2019, feeling like he was running on empty, and it took a first winter off since he was 17 for him to re-gain that spark. ",
            "His next appearances would be in India at the start of 2021, benefitting from a rotation policy aimed at keeping time in bio-secure Covid-19 bubbles to a minimum. Then, when it looked like he would start the summer, a freak accident - slipping in the Surrey dressing room while wearing socks and tearing his hamstring - meant a spell on the sidelines and seemingly a drift out of selectors' thoughts. ",
            "Yet he emerged in the 2022 summer as the go-to man under the new leadership duo of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, after donning the gloves in the West Indies after England lost 4-0 in the 2021/22 Ashes. Despite not possessing the bombastic strokeplay encouraged under the new regime, his calmness in front of the stumps has seen him assume the role of firefighter. That was particularly evident in his 113 not out against South Africa - his first century at home, and second overall - at Old Trafford in August 2022 which allowed England to post 415/9 declared having been 147 for 5. They would win the game by an innings to square the series, taking it 2-1 at the Oval in the next Test. ",
            "Foakes, the son of the former football referee Peter Foakes, who encouraged his interest in sport, but died suddenly when his son was 13, emerged as a promising wicketkeeper-batsman at Essex, earmarked from an early age as an England prospect, but due to the longevity of James Foster, another one-time prodigy, he left to seek further opportunities with Surrey at the end of 2014. It was a wise choice. He realised that he found it hard to motivate himself when he played for Essex as a batsman, but the moment he got the chance to work on his wicketkeeping with Bruce French in England age-group sides his enthusiasm was unbounded.",
            "A regular at youth level for his country, Foakes was England's leading run-scorer at the 2012 U-19 World Cup, having made 93 on Championship debut earlier in the summer. Picked for the Lions' limited-overs tour of Australia in 2012-13 before making his List A debut, Foakes was Bairstow's understudy in Sri Lanka the following winter - a role he was used to filling at Essex, with Foster still going strong. He made his maiden first-class and Championship centuries during the 2013 season and, in a mark of England's future planning, was invited to train with the squad and act as 12th man for the first Ashes Test of the summer at Trent Bridge. At 19, with only five first-class matches for Essex, he was selected for the England Lions' tour of Australia at the start of 2013. The tour proved almost as disastrous as the senior tour Down Under later that year, and yet Foakes won a significant admirer: Andy Flower, who was en route to New Zealand for England's series there. ",
            "It was another season before Foakes got the gloves on a full-time basis at Surrey, but eventually he ousted Steve Davies, leaving Davies confused as to the exact nature of his ambitions: he left for Somerset at the end of 2016. Gary Wilson, another regular Surrey wicketkeeper, moved to Derbyshire. Foakes averaged 44 in the Championship, including a career-best 141 not out against Hampshire in July to turn Surrey's season. He could be an attritional batsman, as his 59 not out from 235 balls against Middlesex in May of that year testified, but he topped the Royal London Cup averages while scoring at better than a run a ball, nothing better than his beautifully-judged 90 against Yorkshire in the semi-final at Headingley.",
            "The following year, he averaged top side of 40 in the Championship but unexpectedly his return in the 50-over competition was even higher as he averaged 96.40, passing 50 in six out of 10 knocks and maintaining a rate of better than a run a ball. Competition among England's wicketkeepers was high, but Foakes edged out Buttler as an Ashes tour deputy, months after Alec Stewart - his county coach and not a man for wild pronouncements - had proposed him as the best wicketkeeper in the world.

He quickly became a key member of T&T's first-class attack, winning selection for the Champions League T20 in 2011 and claiming a maiden five-wicket haul against Barbados in the semi-final of the regional four-day competition in April 2012.",

His next Test came nearly a year later, but it kicked off a run in which Gabriel has been a regular in the side as a muscular enforcer. Against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2016, he took six wickets, and a few months later in the return series, he went a few better with 9 for 92 in Bridgetown in a series-levelling win for West Indies. Unlike in that game, Gabriel's finest hour, his 13 wickets against Sri Lanka in Gros Islet in 2018, came in a draw.",

Then he swung wildly at a loopy delivery outside off stump and played on, handing the match, the last Test for Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq, to Pakistan."

The winner of two Ricky Ponting Medals as Tasmania's best player of the summer, Geeves also played in two domestic one-day final victories for the Tigers, including one in which he was Man of the Match. A very capable batsman, Geeves suffered the frustration of twice being stranded on 99 not out in Sheffield Shield games - both in the 2008-09 season, and both resulting from the No.11 Tim Macdonald being dismissed. He ended his career without a century. Off the field Geeves made a name for himself for his quirky blog writing and radio commentary."

            "However, he refused to concede his playing days were over and continued in England one-day colours, hanging grimly to a place until he was omitted from the 2007 World Cup squad. Not one for a quiet ending, after three years at Essex he returned to Yorkshire as captain on a two-year deal in 2007.",
            "Gough was not blessed with the height of Curtly Ambrose or Glenn McGrath - and thus lacked a stock ball to match. He developed other means of claiming wickets by watching, experimenting and learning. In the process he became England's first and foremost exponent of reverse swing and a fine changer of pace. ",

            "Nobody contributed more to England's four series wins in a row in 2000 and 2000-01 than Gough, who was Player of the Series against West Indies and in Sri Lanka. Succeeding there and in Pakistan, the traditional graveyard of fast bowlers, was the final stage of his development, although even his self-confidence took a battering after England's failure to compete against Australia the following summer.",
            "He injured his knee during a one-day series in New Zealand - it seemed trivial at the time, but mushroomed into a year of misdiagnosis and aborted comebacks. He was forced out of the Ashes tour and the 2003 World Cup, but somehow willed himself back to fitness in time for the English season that year. And though he was instrumental in England's NatWest Series victory, he was exposed in Test cricket, from which he retired after a heavy Lord's defeat against South Africa. ",

            "Harry Gurney, a left-arm seamer with an ungainly action and intelligent variations, won opportunities for England in one-day cricket in 2014 in the first home series under the new set-up of Peter Moores as national coach and James Whitaker as national selector. But he failed to make the cut for the 2015 World Cup and, after Moores was sacked after a disastrous tournament, Gurney's England chances receded and his priorities again rested with Nottinghamshire where Moores was soon to renew coaching links with him.",
            "In another era, that might have meant he was left to rue his missed chances while stuck on the county treadmill. But instead, his short-form credentials and impressive record in the death overs meant he found a new lease of life on the T20 circuit. He won the 2018-19 Big Bash with Melbourne Renegades in his first winter of franchise cricket, and was picked up by Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL auction to boot. He gave up red-ball cricket at Notts in 2019 to maximise his earning potential, and won the CPL with Barbados Tridents later that year. Injuries blighted his 2020, but he signed a new deal at Trent Bridge to extend his career further.",
            "Gurney played club cricket for Loughborough Town before graduating through Leicestershire's age group system. He missed most of 2007 with an ankle injury but made his first-class debut towards the end of the season and picked up a couple of wickets against Northamptonshire. In early 2008, while playing for Leeds-Bradford University, he showed his promise by removing Michael Vaughan and Jacques Rudolph.",
            "His county career briefly hit problems in 2009 when after winning three summer contracts while studying economics at Leeds University, he was released by Leicestershire and invited to prove himself worthy of a contract the following April, something he initially refused before buckling down to win favour.  He remained something of a short-format specialist and was Leicestershire's leading wicket-taker in the 2011 Friends Life t20 with 23 scalps, but he missed Leicestershire's Finals Day victory with a side strain.",
            "His development as a four-day player made big strides after he joined Nottinghamshire at the end of the 2011 season - joining the likes of James Taylor and Stuart Broad in the move across the East Midlands in search of greater recognition. Gurney went on to take 21 wickets in 10 Championship appearances for his new county compared with three from only one opportunity for Leicestershire in 2011. When he doubled the tally in 2013, his reputation as a solid county performer had been established.",
            "Gurney's reputation began to blossom in 2013 when he finished the Championship season as Nottinghamshire's leading wicket-taker, taking 44 wickets at 30, enough to catch the eye of the England management who invited him to pre-Ashes nets along with another left-arm quick, Tymal Mills, to prepare England (unsuccessfully as it turned out) for an expected onslaught from Mitchell Johnson. ",
            "Gurney's success in white-ball cricket had also captured the attention. More good news followed when he was picked in the England squad for a limited-overs tour of West Indies and named as a travelling reserve for the ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. He had a habit of taking top-order wickets and was adept bowling yorkers at the death. Add England's constant craving for left-arm quick bowlers and he had much to commend him. ",
            "That won him 10 ODIs and two T20s in 2014 as England took a long look at him. After making an ODI debut against Scotland in Aberdeen, he acquitted himself ably in five ODIs against Sri Lanka - his best return coming with four wickets at Lord's - but only made one further appearance against India in the one-day series at the end of the season. Selection followed for an ODI series in Sri Lanka the same year - his first overseas tour. \"I want to go to the World Cup and win it,\" he pronounced, but he missed out to his county team-mate Stuart Broad, back from injury, and with Eoin Morgan assuming the captaincy and Moores replaced as coach, his international career looked over.",
            "Gurney's stock as a bowler remained high, and there was time, too, for a personal tour de force with the bat. Gurney was a poster boy for No. 11 batsmen, but his career-best display as the 2017 season died away could not have come at a more crucial time. Notts were in danger of following-on against Sussex at Hove on the third day, and defeat would have cost them promotion, but Gurney's 42 not out in a last-wicket stand of 73 with Matt Carter followed up a farewell century by Chris Read and helped to plot a remarkable escape."

        "bio": [
            "With his lofty, loose-limbed gait and his painful capacity for jamming fingers against bat-handles, Steve Harmison had for some time been drawing tongue-in-cheek comparisons to the great Curtly Ambrose, when suddenly, in Jamaica in March 2004, he loped in to produce a spell of irresistible fast bowling that Ambrose himself could hardly have bettered. West Indies were blown away for 47, and Harmison's figures of 7 for 12 were the best in Tests at Sabina Park. It was a stunning riposte from a man who, only months earlier, had flown home injured from England's tour of Bangladesh with whispers about his diffidence chasing him all the way. But as much as Jamaica 2004 set the benchmark, Brisbane 2006 proved a low point as his opening delivery of the Ashes series went straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip and his desire was once again questioned.",
            "Harmison, who was born in Ashington - the Northumberland village where the footballing Charlton brothers first saw the light of day - was barely 20 when he went with England A to South Africa in 1998-99, but after that he was held back by a series of niggling injuries - including somehow dislocating his shoulder when he caught his hand in his trouser pocket while bowling - and a tendency to fall homesick when confined to barracks on overseas tours. He eventually broke into the Test team in mid-2002, after an injury to another tearaway, Simon Jones, but for a long time he was no better than promising, with a tendency to mix magical spells with moments when the radar would go badly awry. But, in the Caribbean, the spiritual home of the fast bowler, he seemed to have finally come of age.",
            "This was born out in the 2004 Test series against West Indies and New Zealand, where he plundered wickets aplenty as England completed a 7-0 clean sweep. But in South Africa the following winter, the doubts crept back in and after ending a miserable Test series with a niggling calf strain, he admitted to the press that he had been hoping to fail his fitness test in order to be allowed home early. Against Bangladesh the following summer, he took a cathartic five-wicket haul in front of his home crowd in Durham, before tearing into Australia's top-order with five wickets on the first morning of the Ashes series at Lord's. He couldn't secure victory on that occasion, but popped up with the most vital strike of his life one Test later, to seal a thrilling two-run win at Edgbaston and set England on their way to an historic Ashes triumph. ",
            "Persistent shin problems hampered his form for the rest of the year, but against Pakistan at Old Trafford in July 2006, he was back to his rampant best, taking 11 wickets in a thumping innings win. That didn't last as his one-day nightmares continued at the Champions Trophy and he entered the first Test at Brisbane woefully short of match fitness. The result was that wide which, as much as his striking of Justin Langer at Lord's in 2005, set the tone for the series. Harmison was anonymous for the first two Tests before finally showing some form in the final three matches - but by then it was too late. After the Perth defeat handed the Ashes back to Australia, Harmison announced his retirement from ODIs, a decision he'd made after the Champions Trophy. It continued to leave more questions than answers. A reputation, and a career, hung in the balance and although he began 2007 in fine style for Durham, his winter nightmares continued to hamper him in the opening Tests against West Indies. A back injury ended his summer prematurely and, in October, was asked by the England management to prove his fitness and form by playing in South African domestic cricket. He came through the subsequent tour of Sri Lanka with credit, despite missing the first Test with back problems, but he was dropped one Test later in New Zealand, after an abject display in a humiliating England defeat at Hamilton.",
            "After being sent back to Durham, he found fiery form for his county and earned a recall for the fourth Test against South Africa. Following a successful return to international colours at The Oval, he was subsequently persuaded by new captain Kevin Pietersen to come out of one-day retirement to face South Africa, and he even went to Antigua to take part in the Stanford Super Series. But before the winter was out the doubts about his commitment had resurfaced once again. He played a peripheral role as England reclaimed the Ashes in the summer of 2009 - returning only for the final two Tests - and when he subsequently lost his ECB central contract and ditched for the tour of South Africa, most observers assumed that this time, it really was the end."

By his ninth delivery, he had taken his first wicket - that too of Brendan Taylor. He finished with 11 wickets in the series, including a five-wicket haul in the second Test in Khulna.",

            "Thus began the tug-of-war between Faruque and Hathurusingha that dragged for more than a year, with the BCB ultimately changing the selection panel and Faruque resigning from his post. Jubair had nothing to do with all these controversies and felt hard done by to be put in the middle of such a high-profile battle.",
            "He was essentially part of the larger debate within Bangladesh cricket about the value of legspin. The skill is highly under-rated in the country, with most domestic teams shunning the legspinner and forcing them to become batting allrounders or turn solely to batting.",
            "But Jubair stuck to his bowling, and impressed everyone during Bangladesh's long training camp in 2014, where he was essentially a net bowler, after he had returned from that year's Under-19 World Cup. Hathurusingha was so taken by Jubair that when Sohag Gazi was suspended for his action by the ICC midway through their West Indies tour, he was discussed as a replacement despite not having played a single first-class game.",

He was starting to be treated as a Test specialist. At the same time, though, his Dhaka Premier League club - Abahani Limited - stopped picking up, hastening a slide in confidence.",
            "It culminated in his poor T20I debut against Zimbabwe in 2015, where he bowled one delivery so short that it nearly bounced twice before reaching Malcolm Waller who took his first over in the format - which happened to be his T20 debut at any level - for 17 runs."

Born in Harare, Kamungozi first learned to play cricket at Chengu Primary School in the township of Highfield. He was a seam bowler at first, but while a student at Highfield High, at around the time he joined Takashinga Cricket Club, he changed to leg spin. He lived close to the Takashinga ground and came under the tutelage of coaches Stephen Mangongo and Walter Chawaguta. Joining Takashinga was also his only chance to continue playing cricket, as the sport was not played at his high school.",

South Africa demolished a woefully under-strength Zimbabwe side, scoring 420, but Kamungozi escaped with relatively light punishment and picked up the wickets of Loots Bosman and Justin Kemp. The following month he toured India with the Zimbabwean team for the ICC Champions Trophy, and did reasonably well against both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh."

He has a high-arm action straight from the coaching manual, and possesses all the weapons in his armoury. But he hasn't always had the breaks and played the understudy to Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh for most of his career. He came close to selection during India's disastrous tour of England in 2011 but Amit Mishra was preferred. \nKartik forced his way into the Indian team in 1999-2000 after impressive performances in the domestic games, but didn't seem to enjoy Sourav Ganguly's confidence and was either used as a defensive option or underbowled. He made his mark as a one-day bowler against West Indies in 2002-03, consistently keeping the batsmen in check on flat pitches. "

In the year 2012, he showed glimpses of improved form and fitness, picking up 38 wickets in 13 matches. He found his rhythm the following season, drawing inspiration from Yuvraj Singh. Kaul's hit-the-deck bustle proved the ideal foil for Sandeep Sharma's swing as Punjab's attack prospered."

There was also a vital return of 3 for 25 in the final success as Queensland came from behind to beat Victoria. In three Sheffield Shield games, including the drawn decider, he had less success.

Injuries then took their toll, leaving him with a challenging task just to keep his county career on track, but always with the knowledge that England's interest had never entirely waned.",

He was unsure whether injuries had curtailed his speed and effectiveness or whether his technique and confidence had simply deteriorated. He became prone to great inconsistency from one day to the next. \"It was a very bad place for me,\" he said. Although a long way from England contention, Meaker reanalysed his action with the help of Kevin Shine, England's fast bowling coach, at the national performance centre in Loughborough and England Lions came calling again in 2016 after a solid Championship season for Surrey which brought him 37 wickets at 31.",
            "Pietermaritzburg-born and raised before his family moved to England in 2001, and a graduate of Cranleigh School, in 2003 he won the Telegraph fast bowling award, the Channel 4 outstanding team player award and the AA Thompson fielding award. He finished his school career by winning the EW Swanton cricket prize and within a fortnight of leaving he received an England Under-19s call-up, having played some pre-season friendlies for Surrey. He made his Surrey debut as a 19-year-old in 2008 and had a spell in grade cricket that winter in Sydney, returning in 2009 with better accuracy to join his pace. Meaker was also the first recipient of the ECB's Harold Larwood Fast Bowling Scholarship to Australia and despite struggling, with the rest of his team-mates, in 2010 made an excellent start to the 2011 season. His efforts bore fruit when he made his debut for England Lions against Sri Lanka A that summer and he was then capped twice by England in the ODI series in India at the end of the season.",
            "In 2011, Meaker took 44 Championship wickets at 22.56; a year later, he returned identical figures. Still below his mid-20s, it was compelling stuff. \"I was flying: swinging the ball both ways, knocking people's poles over for fun and thinking this is fantastic, I'm the new Allan Donald,\" he said. He continued to interest England, playing in two T20s at the end of another India tour in 2012. But his progress was undermined by repeated injuries and, on the rare occasions he was fit, a tendency to bowl too many four balls striving for extra pace.",
            "A knee operation at the end of the 2013 season scuppered his chances of an Ashes series in Australia. On other occasions, his injuries just made him seem unfortunate. He was struck in the groin in pre-season nets in 2016 and realised that he was not wearing a box. He needed an emergency operation and by the time he returned for Surrey he felt that, at 27, even his county career could not be entirely guaranteed, but recovered form enough to fire up his ambitions yet again of a bright future. His captain, Gareth Batty, told him just to run in and bowl fast, and the hope was that the swing and consistency that had also characterised him at his peak would return.",
            "But despite a decent Blast in 2017, he struggled for regular cricket over the next few seasons due to a combination of inconsistency and regular injuries. He left The Oval despite having a year left on his contract ahead of the 2020 season, moving to Sussex in an attempt to get his career back on track."

He had had a solid State Championship that season, taking 20 wickets at 26.55, but his impact in his two Tests against Australia was limited. O'Brien managed only one wicket in each match and faded from the national selectors' radar until 2006-07, when he was included in Test and ODI squads for Sri Lanka's tour of New Zealand. He wasn't used, however, and had to settle for being the leading wicket-taker in the State Championship with 34 victims at 20.85. Those figures were enough to keep him in the frame and he finally added to his Test tally in South Africa in November 2007 after he was a late replacement in the touring party because of an injury to Kyle Mills."

            "A promising career with the national team looked certain when Dhammika Prasad took two wickets in as many balls in his first over of his ODI debut against Bangladesh in 2006. He went on to play two more matches before his career was cut short by a back injury which kept him out of the game for six months. Having recovered, he was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour to England in 2007 where he hoped to perform well and regain his place in the national team. What may have helped him in this quest was his ability to bowl at the death in ODIs, having worked hard to develop subtle variations including a good yorker. Consistent performances on the domestic front earned him a first Test cap against India in August 2008 as Sri Lanka sought to add pace to their attack. He did not disappoint, taking five wickets in the match, including the wicket of India's best batsman, Virender Sehwag, in both innings. "

            "Among Bangladesh's pace bowlers in the post-2000 era, Robiul Islam has been one of the few whose steady upswing went mostly unnoticed. It wasn't just that the media or the cricket fans remained oblivious of his performances, but many people close to the cricketing fraternity in Bangladesh only started to know him after he made his Test debut at Lord's.",
            "Born in Satkhira, a small coastal town in the southwest of Bangladesh, Robiul worked through the league system in the region after picking up the game at an early age. Once he had made it to the Dhaka leagues, he was quickly picked up by the Khulna divisional side in the National Cricket League, the first-class competition. He began well, taking a five-wicket haul in only his second game and finishing the 2005-06 season with 13 wickets. The next two seasons weren't great but in the following two seasons, Robiul took 71 wickets and was promptly picked in the senior side.",
            "His debut Test in 2010 didn't go to plan as he went wicketless and a chink in the run-up was evident. He worked hard on both, returning to the Test side a year later in Harare where he bowled a long spell on the second day to bring Bangladesh back into the game. But he remained a Test specialist, and his best performance coming in the first Test in Harare in 2013 when he took nine wickets in the game, taking the first six Zimbabwe wickets in the second innings."

            "Sajidul Islam is one of the many BKSP (Bangladesh Sports Institute) graduates who have gone on to greater success, but he is different from the others on one point: he came back after being written off. He is one of those rare cricketers in Bangladesh who returned to the Test team more than five years after playing his first two Tests. He made his debut in New Zealand in 2008, called up as a replacement for Syed Rasel. He impressed in those conditions, swinging the ball and even dismissing Stephen Fleming. But once he was home, he was shooed away. In 2013, he made a successful return in the Test side when he played against Zimbabwe in Harare.",
            "A left-arm pace bowler, Sajidul's strength is the natural angle to the right-hand batsman as well as the delivery that moves away from the left-hander. It is hard to get both in Bangladeshi conditions but Sajidul has often taken early wickets, and is usually useful with the second new ball too. He doesn't operate with a lot of pace but generates enough to trigger movement which ultimately brings him the wickets.",
            "While studying in BKSP, Sajidul played in the Dhaka Premier League for a few seasons but was usually erratic. He became far more disciplined once he made it to the Barisal Division side in the National Cricket League. Since 2005-06, he played the next five seasons for this divisional side though he was from up north, Rangpur, which at the time didn't have a first-class team. Sajidul wasn't good enough to break into the Rajshahi Division side, but he wheeled away for Barisal.",
            "After two modest seasons, the 2007-08 season went so well for Sajidul that he was the first call the selectors made when Rasel was injured in the New Zealand tour. He went there with 36 first-class wickets that season, at an average of 19.63. After the two Tests, and the subsequent snub from those same selectors, the next three seasons went by without many great performances.",
            "In the 2012-13 season, Sajidul picked up 24 wickets for Rangpur Division, but it was not even good enough to get him into a team in the Bangladesh Premier League. The call finally came when Sylhet Royals coach Mohammad Salahuddin sought his services ahead of a crucial game in the 2013 tournament. Sajidul, already looking for a gig, complied gleefully as he picked up three for 23 in the race-to-the-final game that was famous for Chris Gayle's marauding century."

It included an eight-wicket innings haul against defending champions Rajasthan, which remains a highlight of his first-class career."

Those performances helped him find a place in the Indian ODI squad for the home series against England in October 2011. He did not make the playing XI in that series or the Tests against West Indies that followed, but finally debuted in the fourth ODI against West Indies in Indore in December. He enjoyed a good bit of success in the match, striking with the last ball of each of his first three overs to derail West Indies."

            "Despite an international career lasting only a few hours, Alfonso Thomas earned a reputation as one of the best death bowlers in world cricket. ",
            "Much of Thomas' career bears the hallmarks of a journeyman: he went from team to team, earning a decent living and occasionally enjoying a day in the sun. But had it not been for the advent of T20 cricket and a somewhat fortuitous call-up as an overseas player in county cricket, it is a career that might never have reached fulfilment.",
            "Thomas' first appearances for Western Province B were not promising. He claimed two wickets in his first three first-class games and did not appear again at that level for a couple of years. By then he had moved to North West and, as well as enjoying more success with the ball, he scored a maiden first-class century batting at No. 10 in adding 174 for the 10th wicket with Garth Roe. A few months later, with his team at 87-7, he added 204 with Morne Strydom against Western Province, with Thomas finishing unbeaten on 95. He claimed his maiden five-wicket haul - 6-26 - against Easterns in his next match.",
            "He claimed three five-wicket hauls in the first five games of 2001-02 and, on the way to finishing the season as his side's highest wicket-taker (he claimed 35 at 22.14 apiece), he was selected for the South Africa side in the Hong Kong Sixes in November 2001 and the South Africa A side to play against the touring India A side.",
            "A successful move to Northerns for the 2003-04 season nudged the selectors and, after an impressive stint with South Africa A, he replaced the injured Andre Nel in the Test squad to India late in 2004. ",
            "It was not until 2007 that he was called into the international side, though. In a T20I against Pakistan, Thomas claimed 3-25 and was arguably the pick of the bowlers in helping his side to a 10-wicket victory. But in a strong era of South African seamers, it was to be his only international appearance.",
            "Instead, in the English summer of 2007, he found himself playing club cricket for Audley in the North Staffs South Cheshire League. Responding to an emergency call-up from Warwickshire - who found themselves hurtling to relegation in the first-class and List A league and had already utilised three overseas players - he played four games and performed relatively well in a struggling side. While it was not enough to avoid relegation or win a longer-term deal, it was enough to attract the attention of Somerset's director of cricket, Brian Rose, who offered a contract as a Kolpak registration for the 2008 season.",
            "It was the start of an enduring and happy relationship, one for which he remained forever grateful. He returned every year until his retirement in 2015, moving his family to Taunton and winning over supporters with his obvious commitment and enthusiasm. Unusually for a seamer in his mid-30s, he also appeared to find another yard of pace.",
            "He claimed a five-wicket haul for Somerset in just his second match and, up until the end of the 2014 season, had claimed 279 first-class wickets at an average of 26.37 for the club. Highlights include leading the club (he captained in the absence of Marcus Trescothick) to the semi-final of the Champions League in 2011 and taking the club to within the brink of their first Championship title in 2010 - Thomas claimed 49 wickets at 24.53 - with the club also finishing second in both limited-overs competitions. In 2014, in a match against Sussex at Taunton, also became the first man in the club's history to take four wickets in four balls in a first-class game.",
            "The increased exposure led to more opportunities for Thomas. He represented Pune Warriors in the IPL in 2011 and 2012, Dhaka Gladiators in the 2013 BPL and Adelaide Strikers (for the 2011-12 season) and Perth Scorchers (for 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons) in the Big Bash. With an excellent yorker and an apparently unflappable temperament, he delivered many match-defining spells of death bowling and remained in high demand in the shortest format. Dhaka won the BPL the year he played for them, as did Perth in 2012-14. When he retired, he was, by some distance, Somerset's highest wicket-taker in the T20 format.",
            "He broke his ankle playing golf in October 2014 but returned to Taunton for his eighth season with the club in 2015, taking his haul in all competitions for the county past 550 wickets. \"The turning point of my career came when a man called Brian Rose showed belief in me,\" Thomas told ESPNcricinfo in 2014. \"I love Somerset.\"\nDown in the West Country, the admiration was mutual."

            "With a 6ft 7in frame that looked cut from stone, Chris Tremlett was a hulking quick bowler of immense ability. His body gave him all the ingredients - pace, bounce and accuracy - to be a world-class fast bowler apart from one: a lack of resilience which curtailed what might have been an outstanding Test career. Instead, England will be primarily grateful for memories of the 2010-11 Ashes series when he was a key part of their series victory in Australia.",
            "It was apt that Tremlett announced his retirement in 2015 after conceding that his body could not stand the rigours of professional cricket any longer. He cut a gentle, passive figure for a fast bowler, which made him an easy target as the injuries mounted and his impact could never be relied upon, with some suspecting that he wilted under pressure, but a lesser figurer would also have abandoned hope much earlier. ",
            "Tremlett played 12 Tests, 15 ODIs and one T20 for England. He made his Test debut against India, at Lord's, in 2007 and bowled impressively in his first series but the twin devils of injury and inconsistency ensured he did not play another Test until the tour of Australia in 2010-11.",
            "His recall in Perth marked the beginning of his most successful spell as an international bowler as he collected 17 wickets in three matches to help England win down under for the first time in 24 years. He took 17 wickets at 23.35, which included the Ashes-winning wicket and fleetingly became part of a strong pack of fast bowlers that led England to the top of the world rankings, following his Ashes success with 15 wickets in three Tests against Sri Lanka. That series led to comparisons with Joel Garner but, having broken into the top ten rankings, injury struck. ",
            "Although he played a Test in UAE against Pakistan the following winter he was not fully fit and had surgery to remedy his back problems soon after. Many believed that would be the end of his international career but he returned to play three more Tests over the subsequent three years - one apiece against India, Sri Lanka and his final appearance against Australia, at Brisbane, in late 2013. The latter was the first Test of England's unhappy Ashes tour in 2013-14, when he passed 50 Test wickets more than six years after his debut. He was a bad, theoretical pick - England's desire for a physically threatening pace attack, and respect for his Ashes record on the previous tour of Australia, flying in the face of his mediocre county form for Surrey. England, oddly, were reported to be shocked by his pace which rarely touched 80mph - 10mph or so down on his previous trip to Australia.",
            "His ODI debut had come two years before his Test bow and he claimed four wickets in his first appearance against Bangladesh in 2005. However, another 14 matches spread over seven years brought just 11 further scalps.",
            "Across a 146-match first-class career for Hampshire and Surrey, he claimed 459 wickets at 28.66 with a career-best of 8 for 96. He also took 180 List A wickets and 75 in T20.",
            "Tremlett came from an esteemed cricketing family: son of Tim Tremlett, the former Hampshire seamer, and the grandson of Maurice, who played for Somerset and England in the 1940s and 50s. He took a wicket with his first ball of first-class cricket, against New Zealand A in 2000 and after impressing for Hampshire made the England Under-19 tour of India in 2000-01, and a place in the first batch of Rod Marsh's academy intakes in 2001-02.",
            "An impressive start to the 2004 season with Hampshire earned him a call up to England's preliminary squad for the ICC Champions Trophy, and the following year he was named in England's new 25-man development squad, ahead of the 2005 Ashes. He made his one-day debut during the 2005 NatWest Series - and was denied a hat-trick against Bangladesh only because the ball bounced off middle stump without dislodging the bails. Despite his domestic performances tailing off in the second half of the 2005 season and a suspicion that he tended to lose rhythm under pressure, Tremlett earned a call-up to the England squad for Pakistan before a hamstring injury ruled him out. It set the precedent for his international career. ",
            "After much injury disruption, he was handed his Test debut against India at Lord's. Troubling the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up with uncomfortable bounce and lively pace, he looked set to be a key man as England looked to forge a new attack after the 2005 generation. Instead injury struck once more.",
            "After missing the 2007-08 winter tours he was included in England's ODI squad to face Scotland but a heel injury ended his hopes. After a frustrating 2009 season, where he played seven Championship matches, he left Hampshire for Surrey. It was a move that worked wonders - Surrey's large squad meant he did not have to play every game - and, after taking 48 Championship wickets, he earned a recall for the Ashes tour that established his reputation as a high-class quick.",
            "There were still a few moments to remind everybody of his talent: five wickets in seven overs to inspire a turnaround victory against Gloucestershire in May 2014. His batting was also much improved as he came within ten runs of a maiden first-class hundred against Leicestershire, playing with a maturity and calmness his batting had previously lacked. His last first-class appearance came for Surrey against Glamorgan at Guildford in 2015 after which he took specialist advice to call time on his career. He was 34, a good age, but it was hard to escape the conclusion, however, that his retirement was clouded with thoughts of what might have been."

            "A left-arm fast bowler, Jaydev Unadkat led India Under-19s' attack in the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He was first spotted at the  Duleep Sinh School of Cricket in Porbandar, where he impressed his coach Ram Odedra with his bowling action and ability to land the ball on the seam. ",
            "After the World Cup, Unadkat was handed an IPL contract with Kolkata Knight Riders and he impressed the bowling coach Wasim Akram, who identified him as one for the future. He was picked for India A's tour of England in June 2010 and had a dream first-class debut, taking a match-winning 13 for 103 against West Indies A at Grace Road. A month later, he joined the Indian Test squad in Sri Lanka as a nets bowler and was included in the squad for the year-end tour of South Africa, where he made his Test debut at Centurion. However, it was a forgettable one, as he went wicketless in 26 overs for 101 runs. He was duly dropped from the Test team, and made a return to the domestic circuit. A significant breakthrough came during India's A tour of New Zealand in 2012-13, where he picked up nine List-A wickets at an average of 15.77 with two four-wicket hauls. He then enjoyed a largely successful campaign with Royal Challengers Bangalore, finishing joint-second on the team's wicket-takers list. His consistent performances helped him gain selection for India's tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, where he made his ODI debut. It proved a largely successful trip, as he picked up eight wickets in five matches. He later played two more ODIs in the upcoming home season - against Australia and West Indies - but went wicketless in both."

            "Vilas' debut Test, in Mirpur, was mostly washed out, but he toured India for four Tests later that year, and replaced an injured Quinton de Kock at the last minute for the Wanderers Test against England in January 2016, arriving 45 minutes after the start of the match, having flown from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg.",
            "Vilas proved to be an excellent acquisition for Lancashire, whom he captained from the 2018 season onwards. He was also one of their few batting mainstays in that relegation season, scoring 235 not out against Somerset and sharing a tremendous recovery stand with Josh Bohannan to salvage an unlikely victory against Worcestershire. Next season he plundered 266 off 240 balls in an innings win over Glamorgan.",

The producers wanted to add authenticity to on-field scenes by using real cricketers - though not, in this case, real fast bowlers.\n"

Rutherford was not his only victim: 18 wickets in six matches were enough to win him a two-year contract until the end of 2018. Whittingham came up through the junior ranks at Roffey, who he helped win the Sussex Cricket League in 2015. ",

Scotland won by seven wickets at Beckenham in a warm-up for the Champions Trophy, but the two-match series was not afforded ODI status, so denying them official recognition of their first win over Full Member opposition. Derbyshire were also the victims as he took his maiden five-wicket haul.",
            "However, injuries would cause a persistent problem. He joined Gloucestershire in 2018 but did not make a single first-team appearance due to a back injury, which prompted retirement at the age of 26 on medical advice."
